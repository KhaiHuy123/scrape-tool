"BRITISH holidaymakers have been warned of increased fines in Spain if they are caught drinking in the street as part of a crackdown on uncivil behaviour. Barcelona city hall chiefs have raised the fine for street boozing to a maximum of £520. The sanction for going to the toilet where you shouldn’t has jumped from £170 to a whopping £260. The fines for graffitiing public buildings has also gone up - from £260 to £430. The new penalties came into force last week following a council announcement a fortnight ago. Barcelona’s Deputy Mayor for Security Albert Battle said fines were being increased to stamp out the sensation of “impunity.” He added: “Our priority is to bring order to everything that happens in public spaces. “Following the COVID pandemic , public spaces are being used more intensively and this has had consequences we need to deal with. “The objectives of our maintenance plans revolve around guaranteeing civility in the city by increasing the financial sanctions for uncivil practices.” Barcelona brought its new fines regime into force as another Spanish council warned it would hit locals and holidaymakers in their pocket if they bought items off unlicensed street sellers. Town hall chiefs in Torrevieja on the Costa Blanca announced an information campaign about its fines of £172 for people purchasing goods from so-called ""looky looky"" men. A spokesman said it was felt important issues relating to demand as well as supply should be targeted. He added: “Part of this campaign is about informing citizens, and especially tourists, who may not be aware of the fines.” The latest crackdown comes as Brits heading to Spain were warned of a simple mistake which could land them with a £170 fine. Cops are said to be keeping their eyes peeled for tourists who lack one thing in particular while behind the wheel - and it's not what you'd think. Brits are being warned to not strip off in the heat, as driving topless could see them slapped with a fine. Majorca Daily Bulletin reported that while being shirtless isn't illegal, Spanish law bans anything that impacts safe driving .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/today-second-saturday-without-state-837526727.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crowd-enjoys-saturday-night-drinks-837526705.jpg",Holiday warning as Brits face £500 fine for rowdy behaviour in Barcelona in latest crackdown on tourists,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23461305/holiday-warning-spain-fines-behaviour-barcelona/
"A FORMER Russian spy who trained at the same KGB school as Putin has revealed how he was interrogated by the ""sadistic"" dictator. Sergei Jirnov worked for Russia 's secret service for seven years - until he was forced into exile in France in 2001 where he became a refugee. Born in 1961 in Moscow , Jirnov joined the KGB in 1984. Like Putin , he is an alumnus of the Red Flag Institute, a secret KGB school that trains the intelligence elite. But the former spy had met Putin four years before in 1980 while he was a volunteer at the Moscow Olympic Games - and gained a unique insight into his twisted mind. Jirnov was interrogated by the Russian dictator after he spoke on the phone to a French citizen requesting information about the sporting event. Putin suspected Jirnov was a spy for France - and grilled him about his connections. And Jirnov said the Russian leader took a ""strange pleasure"" in the interrogation. During the tense interrogation, Putin thought he caught him out when he referenced a banned book. But Jirnov revealed he had been gifted the book by the family of Leonid Brejnev - leaving fearful Putin with no choice but to let him go or risk the wrath of Soviet leadership. ""Andrei was a good friend of mine and a faculty colleague. Putin was stunned at that moment and let me go,"" he said. Jirnov revealed that Putin was a ""jealous"" KGB officer who ""adored power"". ""In 1980, Putin was a person who adored power,"" he said. ""When he interrogated me, I felt a strange pleasure of him. He had a sadistic pleasure when interrogating people. ""I also felt a jealousy from him regarding the persons who are better than him. And this jealousy increased over the years."" And Jirnov now believes Putin could face the same fate as Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu - who was overthrown and executed by a firing squad in a revolution in 1989. A lightning mutiny by Russia’s Wagner Group mercenaries exposed cracks in Putin's increasingly weak grip on power . It's thought Putin may have a leadership crisis on his hands - with plenty of wolves waiting in the wings and willing to claw their way to power. ""I think Putin is the person the most detested by the Russian elites, because the war he started will be lost,"" the former spy said. ""And this war has brought huge losses for Russia . ""The removal from power of Putin is the only solution, although it actually seems impossible. ""But remember that the removal of the Romanian dictator Ceausescu also seemed impossible until 1989. ""I think Putin could have the same fate as Nicolae Ceausescu. ""When Russia loses the war, the country will dismantle like the Soviet Union."" The former KGB spy met Putin for the final time in 1990, while he was on mission accompanying the French composer Pierre Boulez. The two met at a reception - but Putin did not tell speak to him. Revealing the inner workings of his mind, Jirnov said Putin thinks of himself as a god - and wants to ""become eternal"". This, he said, has made the dicatator a sociopath with no empathy. Jirnov told L'Echo : ""He read almost nothing in his life, except children's fairy tales when he was 6 years old, which he still often refers to today. ""He's a street child, he was beaten, maybe abused. He learned cruel things. He had no physical strength, that's why he learned trickery. ""After 23 years in power, Putin began to think of himself as a god. ""His entourage told him what he wanted to hear and distilled bad information. ""He wants to become eternal, which pushes him towards mystical things. ""I'm Russian, and I say Putin is killing Russia. He's a sociopath. He has no empathy. He's not rational anymore."" It comes after The Sun interviewed another former spy who trained at the same top military academy as Putin. Aliia Roza, 38, now a life coach, said Putin ""brainwashed"" the Russian population using techniques that the KGB instils ""in your DNA "". The mum-of-one believes Putin’s spy training is responsible for his rise to power - and underneath his infamous strongman image is a manipulative and intimidating operator. And his ruthless spy techniques have persisted as he tries to maintain his rule during Russia's most unstable period.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sergei-Jirnov-in-KGB-personal-archive.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sergei-Jirnov-in-KGB-01-personal-archive.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sergei-Jirnov-KGB-ID-Credit-personal-archive-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/92ba1ca4-b6d0-4634-b6e3-4453dfe95b4b.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1e106801-d874-4c8d-aeec-1a3866f03788.jpg",I’m an ex-KGB spy who was interrogated by Putin…I know how his sadistic mind works and the gruesome fate that awaits him,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23402986/former-kgb-spy-putin-sadistic-mind-overthrown-killed/
"A ""SEX SLAVE"" held in captivity for 14 years was subjected to a vile crucifixion-like torture when her jailer left home . Sinister new footage has shown the damp, cockroach-infected hell where Ekaterina Belyankina, now 33, was held since the age of 19 before escaping last week. Vladimir Cheskidov, 51, has been remanded in custody for two months by a judge pending further investigations into his alleged crimes. When he went out, Ekaterina - known as Katya - had been forced to lie on the floor, wearing a homemade wooden head and neck noose, so she could not escape. Her arms and legs were tethered to metal brackets fixed to chipboard in a crucifixion position, and her mouth was taped so she could not call for help. Russian state television said: “It was impossible to escape from this trap as the sadist invented a special device where he placed the woman during his absence."" An investigator stated: ""Cheskidov [the suspect] used two sheets of chipboard with metallic staples to harness Ekaterina’s limbs. “He placed wooden noose on her head [and neck], then he taped her face and mouth so that she could not call for help.” The maniac is accused of raping her “thousands of times” and keeping her in a cramped room behind two locked doors, one of them iron. He is also suspected of the murder of another woman named Oksana at his house in 2010 or 2011. Oksana's dismembered bones were found at his premises in Smolino village, Chelyabinsk region, it is alleged. The bones were found in a “saucepan”, and Ekaterina also revealed she had witnessed the other woman being killed in a barn owned by Cheskidov, and had been threatened with the same fate if she disobeyed him. Ekaterina finally escaped from her incarceration last week, after 14 years when the “sadist” got drunk. In the horrifying room where she was kept, tacky pornographic pictures were plastered on the wall. Children’s dolls were found and earlier it was revealed investigators took away multiple sex toys used to torture her. His mother Valentina, 72, who lived at the same house, faces a charge of kidnapping, which could see her jailed for 15 years. Ekaterina - known as Katya - was forced to cook for the mother and play chess with her kidnapper, as well as have sex with him. In court , Cheskidov said his relationship with Ekaterina was one of “love”. His mother claimed: “She joined my son and lived like a queen… No-one kept her.” She insisted: “Katya lived [with us] on her own free will. All the women are drawn to him. He is a non-drinker, non-smoker, and positive. Everyone needs such men. A workaholic."" He faces life in a grim Russian penal colony if convicted of the alleged crimes.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sex-slave-ekaterina-belyankina-33-836810058.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russian-man-vladimir-cheskidov-51-836014006.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sex-slave-ekaterina-belyankina-33-836810110.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sex-slave-ekaterina-belyankina-33-836810196.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ekaterina-belyankina-now-33-fled-836809958.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ekaterina-belyankina-now-33-fled-836809971.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sex-slave-ekaterina-belyankina-33-836810105.jpg",‘Sex slave’ was tortured with sick ‘crucifixion device’ by monster as she was held for 14 years in grim dungeon,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23397167/crucifixion-device-russia-sex-slave-crime-jailer-torture/
"A TEENAGER was killed and another critically injured after they fell from a high-speed ride at an amusement park on Sunday. The tragedy occurred in the popular resort town of Cap d’Agde on France's southern coast after suspected strong winds rocked the ride at Luna Park and the two victims fell 180ft. Local prosecutor Raphael Balland said: ""Two people were victims of an accident while using the Adrenaline attraction. ""An adolescent aged 17 died of his injuries and a young woman of 19 was taken to hospital at Montpellier as an absolute emergency (case)."" Balland said that the teenagers struck obstacles as they plunged from the cable swing ride, which is believed to reach speeds of 70mph. The 17-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene, while the 19-year-old woman is in critical condition in hospital after suffering multiple traumas. The park closed on Sunday morning following the accident. An investigation has been opened and four people, including the theme park manager, were taken into custody to be questioned by police. They have since been released as the investigation continues. Cap d'Adge mayor Gilles d'Ettore said that Saturday night had been very windy, which was ""very rare for Agde"". He indicated that the strong gusts could have allegedly caused the accident. Prosecutors will be seeking to determine whether the rides should have been operating during the alleged high winds and whether there was a mechanical failure. The ""Adrenaline"" attraction involves passengers strapping into harnesses and being winched 180ft into the air. They are then released to swing on the cable at high-speeds. Witnesses told local media sources that the cable had deviated from its usual path, which led to the riders allegedly hitting the metal pylon that holds the attraction up and then being ejected from their harnesses. The investigation is ongoing. Local news outlet, Midi Libre, reported that a man received stitches in hospital after grazing his head on the ground after riding on ""Adrenaline"" in 2019. In 2015 at the same park, a young couple were thrown from a slingshot ride when it snapped mid-air. They were left hanging on the ride for over an hour as firefighters worked to rescue them. The woman reportedly suffered a broken leg, while her partner walked away only bruised.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/af0062c6-a938-4ffb-b5d2-02c2f0fd3565.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teen-17-killed-theme-park-836573614.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teen-17-killed-theme-park-836573615.jpg","Luna Park – Teen, 17, killed on theme park ride ‘Adrenaline’ after ‘being thrown from 70mph cable swing in high winds’",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23373339/teen-killed-theme-park-france/
"A BRITISH man has been seriously injured in a fatal stabbing in the Costa Blanca town of Torrevieja. The 40-year-old was rushed to hospital with head injuries and a knife wound to his abdomen. A Dutch man of the same age died in the incident, which is under police investigation, and a Finnish man aged 48 was left fighting for his life. Neighbours sounded the alarm around 3am on Saturday morning after hearing shouting coming from a semi-detached house at a residential estate called Torreta III on the outskirts of Torrevieja. The Dutch victim, initially confused for another Brit, is understood to have received several stab wounds which affected his vital organs. He was already dead by the time emergency responders arrived and stabilised the two injured men before getting them to the hospital. Police in Alicante confirmed this morning that the British man remains in serious condition following the attack. A spokesman for the Civil Guard said: “Investigators are waiting to see whether their conditions improve so they can question them about their level of involvement in the altercation if and when they can be discharged from hospital. The Civil Guard has opened an ongoing investigation into the incident and claimed an inspection of the property has already been conducted to obtain evidence and help officers clarify what happened. The violent attack saw a number of knives and a hammer reportedly used as weapons. The Finnish man, who was admitted to a hospital intensive care unit, is understood to live at the property where the deadly fight occurred and initial reports point to the possibility he caused the Dutch man's death. The other two men had called round for reasons which police have to elaborate on. The residential area the homicide occurred once featured heavily in a Spanish prime-time television game show in which contestants competed for money and other prizes. La Torreta was the estate picked by the show, called ""Un, dos, tres..responda otra vez"" in Spanish, to gift winners' houses. It was the first television show format exported outside Spain, with versions aired in the UK as well as Portugal and the Netherlands . The economic crisis of 2008 led to many residents falling behind on their mortgage payments and squatters moving in to occupy properties seized by banks. The Civil Guard has yet to formally comment on Saturday morning’s incident but is expected to make a statement as and when the two survivors are well enough to be questioned. This comes after a Brit woman was found dead in a Costa Blanca apartment as her husband was arrested while attempting to flee the scene. The 64-year-old was found with stab wounds in Orihuela Costa, south of Alicante at around 4am on March 26. And in 2018, two Brits were stabbed outside a bar in the Costa Blanca resort of Torrevieja after they fell into an argument with two Romanians. The injured Brits were rushed to Torrevieja Hospital where they were found to be suffering from severe but not life-threatening injuries.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fk9r2d-cityscape-torrevieja-alicante-province-500827680.jpg,Brit seriously injured in horror stabbing that left Dutch man dead in Costa Blanca knife rampage,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23373421/brit-seriously-injured-deadly-stabbing-spain-knife-rampage/
"A UKRAINIAN mum who survived a suspected assassination attempt has posed for the cover of Playboy. TV presenter Iryna Bilotserkovets can be seen wearing a metal bikini and eye patch after reconstructive surgery rebuilt her face. The model, whose husband is an aide to Kyiv 's mayor Vitali Klitschko, was struck by bullets whilst driving home through the capital with her three children last year. The incident, which took place on February 26, 2022 - just three days after Russia invaded Ukraine - resulted in her undergoing months of emergency treatment and reconstructive surgery in Berlin. Yet despite doctors in Ukraine saying she was “probably going to die”, the mum defied the odds and has since become a symbol of resistance in her home country. She has now appeared on the front of the first Playboy edition to be printed in the country since Vladimir Putin 's war broke out. Speaking to the magazine about seeing herself in the mirror for the first time after treatment, she said: ""An eye missing, tubes sticking out everywhere, hair shaved off from surgery. ""Stitches, scars, wounds everywhere; I was just Frankenstein's monster. My jaw had shattered, like a twig. ""I no longer have a pretty face, but the rest of my body is beautiful."" Ms Bilotserkovets said she was left with a missing eye, a broken jaw, and scars over her body and had to undergo four operations. But she admits that staying alive was most important than prioritising the way she would look. She added: ""It was not a question of preserving my beauty; it was a question of whether I would live or not."" Playboy Ukraine said that the model, who now works with Ukraine's cultural forces to put on events for troops, was a heroine in its 'Women Stay Strong' edition - the first to be printed in more than 18 months. The magazine looks at the ""resilience of Ukrainian women who have been injured during the war but who have not lost their thirst for life"". Playboy confirmed that proceeds from sales will be donated to emergency medical equipment for the Ukrainian army. After Putin invaded Ukraine, the publisher stopped running its magazine edition and solely operated online. This month’s is the first version to be printed since the start of last year.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-dailymail-co-uk-news-836000790-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/battle-beauty-ukrainian-mum-survived-835999828.jpg",Ukrainian mum who survived assassination attempt poses for Playboy after reconstructive surgery rebuilt her face,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23343462/ukrainian-mum-survived-assassination-playboy/
"CIVIL war is breaking out across the Med as sunstarved Brits battle each other for the best spots by pools and beaches. British tourists in popular destinations such as Spain , the Balearic Islands and Turkey are going to extreme measures to bag the best sun loungers. They include queuing from 5.30am to wait for pool areas to open hours later, and heading to beaches at the crack of dawn to reserve areas with towels. Sun readers have even caught fellow countrymen and women claiming sun loungers at 11.30pm the night before to ensure they have a prime location to catch some rays. Care worker Jo Hillyard, 48, described her trip to Turkey as the “worst holiday we have been on” because of inconsiderate Brits. Pictures taken at her hotel in Oludeniz show rows of sunbeds near the pool with towels on to reserve them — before midnight. By 3.30pm the next day, all the loungers were claimed with towels — but only half were being used. Jo spent nine days at the family -friendly Katre Hotel in the resort but was unable to get sunbeds near the pool for any of her stay. Instead she was forced to spend £20 each day on sunbeds on the nearby beach with husband Simon, 50, and sons Callum, 20, and JJ, 14 because of the sun lounger hoggers. Jo said: “It’s shocking. The only time you can get a bed is if you’re lucky enough when someone goes home. ""It’s the worst hotel I have been to by far. It’s British and Turkish tourists here but it is mainly the British who are hogging all the beds. “People put their towels out by 11.30pm for the following day. For our entire holiday we have not been able to get a bed near the pool like my children want.” HAVE you spotted any inconsiderate sunbed hoggers while on holiday this year? Get in touch on WhatsApp on 07423 720250 or email exclusive@the-sun.co.uk When contacted by The Sun, the hotel said they had put up a notice asking guests not to place towels on the beds. But even fleet-footed former Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor, 36, admitted he had raced down early in the morning to bag the best beds. Agbonlahor, who was on holiday on the Spanish island of Majorca last week, said: “I’m guilty, I’ve done it. ""I did it last week, I went down early doors. I was down at 7am, two towels down, baseball cap down, suntan cream bag down. “You have to, otherwise you won’t get a seat. If everyone else is doing it, you’ve got to do it.” In the Costa del Sol resort of Torremolinos, Brits have been filmed running to grab sunbeds when the gates to the pool area were opened. And in Tenerife , dad-of-two Matthew Vine, 46, was stunned when he spotted sunseekers claiming beds at 6.30am — three and a half hours before the pool opened. Some were seen dragging beds from where they had been chained up to reserve their perfect spot. Matthew, from Wetherby, West Yorks , said it was a daily occurrence on his family’s two-week break. He added: “I think they see one do it and panic sets in — suddenly they’re all doing it.” A representative from Matthew’s hotel, the Globales Suneo Tamaimo Tropical in Puerto De Santiago, said: “It is forbidden to reserve sunbeds in all our hotels . ""It is verbally indicated to guests when checking in, and in the sunbathing areas it is also indicated with signs. “We are doing our best, including chaining sunbeds so that people do not come to book sunbeds at unseemly hours despite the fact that we have enough sunbeds. “This is not a problem unique to our hotel, but is repeated in many hotels. ""We are looking for solutions to this problem that do not cause even bigger problems, although all this would not be necessary if people took heed of our indications.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-tourists-many-uk-queue-835475354.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/early-bird-catches-worm-say-833848414.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/c7b0450c-ae47-45c6-aecf-1986fdad73eb.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunbed-madness-holidaymakers-sprint-nab-835467074.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hoilday-9-days-able-get-835637572.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bull-run-hilarious-moment-desperate-832703054-1.jpg",Sunbed ‘civil war’ breaks out across Med as sun-starved Brits battle each other for best spots from 5am,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23314206/brits-sunbed-battles-mediterranean-holidays/

"A GROUP of female rubbish collectors were left stunned after scooping a whopping 100 million rupees on the Kerala lottery. Eleven workers pooled their money to buy a 250-rupee lottery ticket in Parappanangad in the Malappuram district back in June. But were overjoyed after being told they'd won a life-changing amount that will be now shared between them - a huge 6.3 million rupees each. The women make just 250 rupees a day collecting non-biodegradable rubbish from households  - which is barely enough to make ends meet. Most have been forced to borrow cash or take out loans to fund their children's education. The group often pooled money together for lottery tickets - putting in small amounts each. But last month, the group decided to buy a 250 rupee ticket for the monsoon bumper prize lottery. One of the winners Kuttimalu, 72, didn't initially have enough cash to contribute - but another member of the group offered to put in 12.5 rupees for her. The two both added 12.5 rupees each and agreed to share any prize money, while the rest of the group put forward 25 rupees each. Kuttimalu told the BBC: ""We didn't expect to win such a huge amount of money!"" Another winner, Radha said: ""This is the fourth time we bought a ticket for the bumper prize. ""We are fourth time lucky!"" The eleven workers only found out they had won the day after the draw - when one of the women's husbands checked the winning numbers. Cherumannil Baby said she would use the winnings to build a new house after her old home was washed away during devastating floods. K Bindu, 50, said she would use the money to finish work on her house after her husband sadly died from liver failure when they couldn't afford to pay for his medical treatment. But she will also use some of the cash to fund her daughter's education. Lakshmi, 49, says her family was facing financial ruin when her husband was unable to get any construction work - but now she says her worries are over. Leela, 56, revealed the winnings will be spent on her daughter's much-needed surgery. Despite winning the life-changing amount the lucky ladies say they'll still be coming to work every day. Leela said: ""We decided one thing, we will not leave this job because it was this collective that brought us prosperity.""

"THIS is the heart-stopping moment panicked parents hurled their children from the windows of a burning apartment block. Quick-thinking locals stood 100ft below on the ground to catch the terrified youngster using sheets in Almaty, Kazakhstan . A raging inferno swept through the 16-storey building after flames engulfed an elevator shaft between the fifth and sixth floors. As smoke and fire spread more than 300 people were evacuated from the block. Nail-biting footage shows an adult holding a tot out of a window and people below frantically run closer to the building gripping a sheet. The toddler is then dropped, plummeting down before being caught in the white cover. Residents then used a mattress to break the fall of an adult leaping from a high up window. Smoke can be seen billowing out of the block in thick plumes and dozens of people watched on in horror. It's understood the emergency stairs could not be used as residents had blocked them. At least 31 people were rushed to hospital - including 16 kids. It's understood there were no fatalities. After arriving at the scene, firefighters brought tall rescue ladders to reach the upper floors of the building, lowering 40 people. The blaze was finally extinguished with the help of 50 firefighters and three ladders. It comes after footage showed the incredible moment a mum saved her four children from certain death by throwing them from the third floor of a burning building. Locals stretched out a blanket as a makeshift safety net to catch the kids as they plummeted from a window of a five-storey apartment block in Istanbul, Turkey . In a startling video filmed from the street below, the mother is seen dropping each child from the window as a cloud of black smoke pours through the opening. Bystanders are heard screaming in terror with some pleading with her not to drop the youngsters from the flat, which was above a parade of shops. One clearly distressed woman is heard crying as the terrifying drama unfolded in the Esenler district, on the city's bustling European side. Each child was carried to an ambulance after they landed on the blanket below.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/terrifying-footage-shows-woman-throwing-835506442.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/terrifying-footage-shows-woman-throwing-835506438.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/terrifying-footage-shows-woman-jumping-835506439.jpg",Heart-stopping moment parents hurl their kids from 100ft window to escape burning building as heroes catch them below,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23288226/heart-stopping-moment-parents-hurl-kids-window-fire/
"A STUDENT was allegedly brutally beaten to death with an iron rod by her cousin after her family turned down his wedding proposal. The victim, identified as Nargis, 25, was found dead in a park near a college in South Delhi on Friday. Officers discovered her beaten body under a bench after they were called to the scene shortly after midday. A Delhi police official said the 25-year-old was found near Delhi University's Sri Aurobindo College. ""An iron rod was found near her body,"" police said, NDTV reports. Nargis' 28-year-old cousin has been arrested. He allegedly spent three days planning the murder and handed himself into the police hours after the killing. The suspect was reportedly seen in the park with Nargis before she was killed. Police said Nargis and her cousin had been in a relationship and had discussed marriage - but Nargis' family disapproved of the decision. The student then reportedly stopped talking to the suspect. He reached out to her and when she rejected him, he allegedly attacked her with an iron rod, police said. A source told the Times of India : ""The accused has claimed that he took the iron rod, which was used in the crime , from his house. ""He claimed that he tried to approach the woman on Monday."" Politicians have been left outraged over the horror killing - and have called for more to be done to protect women in the city. Swati Maliwal, the chief of Delhi's Commission for Women, said: ""I appeal to the central government to call a meeting regarding the safety of women in Delhi."" Delhi's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal added: ""Another daughter was brutally murdered in Delhi, it is very sad. "" Law and order has become a serious issue in Delhi. ""The safety of the daughter of Delhi and the people of Delhi is very important.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pure-evil-student-beaten-death-834723705.jpg,Student beaten to death with iron rod by cousin after her family ‘refused his wedding proposal’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23240629/student-beaten-death-iron-rod-cousin-proposal/
"BRIT tourists whose holidays to Greece have been left in tatters have been given some hope as trips are being diverted to Spanish resorts. Thousands of holidaymakers have been left stranded in the burning country as a host of airlines cancelled flights for the foreseeable future. Ferocious blazes sweeping through Rhodes and Corfu have crippled the nation in recent days, forcing 30,000 locals and tourists to flee . Brits have been forced to sleep on airport floors waiting for a spot on a repatriation flight - serving as a stark warning to those who were due to travel to Greece . Families could lose thousands of pounds if they cancel their bookings and their airline is still operating, despite the worsening situation. Tour operators are now shunting travellers to resorts across Spain as a consolation prize for their holiday plans that have been shattered. Holidaymakers will reportedly be diverted to the likes of Majorca , Andalusia, Catalonia and Valencia over the next ten days. Travel firms, airport chiefs and transport bosses are working in unison to reroute passengers and save their summer holidays. Additional off-peak flights are being added while hotels are hoping to fill their maximum capacity to ensure Brits can enjoy a break. Majorca is expected to take on the brunt of holidaymakers, while more than 1,000 flights a day are scheduled to land in Palma over the weekend. President of Balearic travel agency Aviba, Pedro Fiol, said he was happy to welcome the influx of tourists, but wished it wasn't under such tragic circumstances. Coach operators chief Rafael Roig added: ""We hope that destinations affected by forest fires recover as quickly as possible."" There are currently still six areas in Greece that pose ""extreme danger"", ten days after the ferocious fires first began. Officials hope they can extinguish them by the weekend, but the British government have urged those intending to travel to do so with caution. But unless they bump up their risk assessment, thousands of holidaymakers could lose out on their cash if they cancel their trip. Current advice instructs Brits to check in with their travel operator or hotel to check if their destination has been impacted by the wildfires. But solicitor Gary Rycroft said the nature of the Foreign Office's guidance will prove ""very important"" to those hoping for a refund. He told iNews : ""If that changes and the advice is not to travel, that will trigger lots of people's travel insurance policies."" Mr Rycroft also reassured those worried about their upcoming package holidays in Greece. He added: ""I would have confidence in the tour company having the intel as to whether they can deliver that holiday or not. ""If they can't deliver it, you will be in line to get compensation."" Yet he warned those who booked their flights and accommodation themselves and want to cancel face ""losing a fair whack of money."" TUI has cancelled some flights and hotels to Rhodes up until the end of this week, but promised people can change their bookings or will receive a full refund. Travel to Corfu is ""currently operating normally"" as a wildfire in the north east was contained, the firm said. All Jet2 flights to Rhodes from the UK have been cancelled until July 30, however flights from the island are operational. Unlike TUI and Jet2, Ryanair are still operating flights to and from Rhodes, as well as Corfu. Meanwhile, easyJet said flights are still heading to Rhodes but they urged passengers to keep an eye on the status of their journeys. Tourists are also eligible to transfer for free to another date, or they can request flight vouchers. Horror stories from stranded families have continued to emerge, with some claiming they were offered ""no assistance ."" Wildfires have also spread to Agioi Theodoroi and parts of Evia , causing further panic for tourists who thought they were safe. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the country is ""at war"" with the wildfires as the staggering heat exacerbates the situation. He warned his nation faces ""another three difficult days ahead"" before temperatures are expected to drop. Rhodes now sports a black scar across the middle of the island after being scorched by flames, prompting Greece's biggest-ever evacuation. Terrified holidaymakers were forced to flee burning hotels , wade through water and sleep in makeshift camps on the floors of schools and gyms. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said up to 10,000 British tourists were stranded on the island, many of whom were facing a ""living nightmare"". Around 450 firefighters and seven planes have arrived from the EU to help tackle the dozens of fires, while neighbouring Turkey sent 20 water-dropping planes and helicopters to join the efforts.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tourists-sleep-wait-departing-planes-833751798.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-apollana-rhodes-greece-flames-834441728.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834023097.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woman-looks-tourists-wait-departing-833827284.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crowded-beach-calp-valencia-spain-763055782-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20pm-karen-got-warning-alert-834237562.jpg",Brit tourists being diverted to Spanish resorts after devastating Greece wildfires leaves holidaymakers stranded,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23208700/brit-tourists-diverted-spanish-resorts-greece-wildfires/
"A SURFER incredibly ""saved his own life"" and swam 600m back to shore after his leg was savaged by a great white shark. The man, in his 20s, miraculously made it back to the sand at Gnarabup Beach in Western Australia alive after his terrifying ordeal. He had been riding the waves in the Margaret River region on Monday morning when he was ambushed by the underwater beast. The extraordinary close call was caught on film thanks to a Swellnet camera overlooking the Boat Ramp surfing spot. Chilling footage shows the shark making its way towards the bloke as a wave breaks, before his surfboard flies through the air. As the sea calms, a singular mighty splash can be seen as the great white launches a ferocious attack on the helpless Aussie. The beast sunk its terrifying teeth into his left leg, locking him in a deathly grip hundreds of metres away from the shore. But the plucky surfer somehow managed to fight the shark off and escape while his gruesome wound was gushing with blood. He then faced a fearsome race back to the beach with the great white hot on his heels. The man was able to paddle back to shore despite losing ""a lot of blood"" and being hindered by his savaged leg. An off-duty nurse rushed to give him first aid and tended to the deep gash on the sand before paramedics arrived. The brave bloke was taken to Margaret River Hospital following the dramatic incident with non-life-threatening injuries. Reports say he was later transferred to Bunbury Hospital for further treatment but is currently in a stable condition. The surfer has been hailed as a hero by beachgoers who watched the horror unfold, who credited him with ""saving his own life."" Onlookers told 9News he had ""lost a lot of blood"" after grappling with the great white at the popular beach Down Under. Chillingly, the shark was spotted lurking nearby just 15 minutes after brutally biting the surfer. The Sharksmart WA website issued an alert warning locals that a shark had been spotted just after 9am. The Shire of Augusta Margaret River then announced all beaches from Gas Bay to Margaret River Mouth would be closed until further notice. A statement said: ""To ensure the safety of our community, please do not enter the water during this time."" The incident marks the seventh shark attack on beaches across Western Australia this year. Western Australia's Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development is investigating the attack. Officials have urged swimmers to take extra care around the Gnarabup and Prevelly area due to the presence of sharks. They are continuing to monitor activity in the region's coastal waters and asked locals to report any sightings to the Water Police on 9442 8600. In February, a teenage girl was mauled to death by a shark after she jumped off her jet ski to swim with a pod of dolphins. Stella Berry had been enjoying a day on Swan River with her pals when she was attacked by what was thought to be a bull shark. A swimmer was then dragged underwater and killed by a shark in front of dozens of fishermen and beachgoers over a week later. The tragedy at Little Bay Beach near Malabar, the first deadly attack in nearly 60 years near Sydney, left witnesses vomiting and shaking . In April, an 11-year-old boy was mauled by a shark while snorkelling just a few metres from the shore in the Shire of Exmouth. A surfer, 46, then passed away after being ambushed by a shark at a popular beach near Elliston in May.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/surfer-s-incredible-act-shark-834198802.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/surfer-s-incredible-act-shark-834198503.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/surfer-s-incredible-act-shark-834198513.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/607a79da-dfb1-4a2e-8d03-169dc609a542.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/surfer-s-incredible-act-shark-834198566.jpg",Terrifying moment surfer is savaged by great white shark before swimming 600m to shore with blood gushing from leg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23187714/surfer-savaged-great-white-shark-swims-shore/
"TAKE a look inside the world's largest office building that is adding some serious sparkle to India's diamond capital - as it's dripping in gems. The Surat Diamond Bourse (SBD) has spared no expense on its sprawling new trade centre that is taking shape in the west of the country. The 15-storey complex boasts 7.1 million sq ft of floor space, knocking The Pentagon off the top spot as the globe's biggest office building. It dwarfs the United States Department of Defense headquarters which has held the title for over 80 years. But the architects behind the build say it was out of necessity rather than competition - as diamond companies snapped up all the offices before construction even began. The SDB sits on more than 35 acres of land and is billed as a one-stop shop for over 65,000 diamond professionals. The incredible office in the city of Surat in India features nine rectangular towers which are interconnected via a central ""spine"". A whopping 131 lifts have been installed to ferry the thousands of people between floors - more than double the elevators in the Burj Khalifa . The SDB will be kitted out with 4,500 diamond merchant offices, which range in size from 300 to 75,000 sq ft. Its interior invites natural light to make firms jewels gleam, while marble floors add some glamour to the £302 million development. Amenities such as conference halls, multi-purpose halls, restaurants, banks and retail shops will also be on offer for bling-loving business buffs. It aims to be a hub for all diamond-related activities, including sales, polishing, manufacturing machines, software and lab-grown gems. International and local buyers are expected to descend on the gigantic office block in droves to take their business that is typically conducted on the streets to the safety of inside. A dedicated custom house with a national diamond research institute, an international convention centre, international education facilities and five-star hotels will also be on offer. It's no surprise the building brimming with jewels will have state-of-the-art security measures - as well as over 4,000 CCTV cameras. A member of the SDB management committee said employees will submit their biometrics , allowing them to access the complex with a ""wave of their hand."" The bourse is set to redefine the diamond trade in India by turning its focus to Surat rather than Mumbai, where office spaces are scarce and uber-expensive. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who is set to unveil the SDB, praised the ambitious project in a tweet last week. He wrote: ""Surat Diamond Bourse showcases the dynamism and growth of Surat’s diamond industry. ""It is also a testament to India’s entrepreneurial spirit. ""It will serve as a hub for trade, innovation, and collaboration, further boosting our economy and creating employment opportunities."" The SDB is finally set to open on November 21, 2023, after four years of construction that was hindered by Covid -related delays. Masterminds at Indian architecture company Morphogenesis won the chance to design the offices after beating international competition. Discussing the details of their creation, the firm said: ""The central spine is used for interconnection between towers on every level. ""The design enhances users' spatial and transitional experience across the building without highlighting the expanse of the structure. ""The central axis connecting all the offices is designed as an interactive hub comprising of break-out spaces, green atriums and a host of visual experiences. ""These spaces have been designed to foster social cohesion and community engagement."" They believe the building's layout will forge a ""level playing field"" for businesses both small and large. The project's CEO, Mahesh Gadhavi, believes the SDB will save thousands of people from travelling - sometimes daily - to Mumbai by train to conduct business. He told CNN: ""It’s difficult … (some) people have to spend three and a half to four hours, daily, to come from their homes to their offices and back home again.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/full-diamonds-surat-diamond-bourse-833841487.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/full-diamonds-surat-diamond-bourse-833841385.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/full-diamonds-surat-diamond-bourse-833841347.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/full-diamonds-surat-diamond-bourse-833841490.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/full-diamonds-surat-diamond-bourse-833841651.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-suratdiamondbourse-about-us-pdf-834012924.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/full-diamonds-surat-diamond-bourse-833841327.jpg",Inside the world’s largest office building with 131 lifts and a giant spine as it takes shape in India’s diamond capital,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23174241/worlds-largest-office-building-indias-diamond-capital/

"HUGE explosions rocked Russian-occupied Crimea after suspected Ukrainian drones targeted an ammunition depot. It is the third daring attack believed to have been masterminded by Ukraine on the annexed region this week in a humiliating blow to Vladimir Putin . Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-installed leader of the region, reported the drone attack had succeeded in hitting an ammunition depot and there were no known casualties. On telegram, he wrote: ""As a result of an enemy drone on the Krasnogvardeisky district, there was a detonation at an ammunition depot. ""A decision was taken to evacuate people [living] within five kilometres"" of the zone,"" he said, adding that: ""To minimise risks, it was also decided to halt rail traffic on Crimean railways."" Footage shows multiple explosions near the city of Simferopol followed by a giant swarm of black smoke. Local sources on social media suggested that drones struck an oil depot and airfield in the region, as well as the ammunition dump. Kyiv has not yet commented on the strike. The Crimean bridge was also allegedly suspended due to the attack but traffic has been reportedly restored. Earlier this week, another major Russian ammunition depot in Crimea exploded sparking a massive mushroom smoke cloud into the air. Dramatic footage from Wednesday shows a huge fireball at the Starokrymsky military training ground. Incessant explosions could be heard from at least 13 miles away that continued for more than five hours. On Monday, at least two were killed after Putin's beloved £3billion Crimea Bridge was rocked by massive explosions. Two blasts rang out on the 12-mile crossing in the early hours as hordes of motorists travelled across it - the second major attack on the bridge since the start of the war. Traffic was brought to a standstill after what was believed to be a kamikaze sea drone attack on the famed bridge.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fcbaed42-e2c6-41f4-af1b-9005458cd09b.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3dd5c60a-7b47-414c-9d17-9582d16d3116-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/708940be-8596-4cc5-8425-7bb128bef117.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1-2-1.jpg",Massive explosion rocks Crimea as ‘Ukrainian drones’ blow up ammo dump in latest blow to Vlad,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23139140/explosions-crimea-ukrainian-drones-attack-oil-depot-putin/
"A YOUNG couple who couldn't afford to buy a home built their own DIY tiny house for only £57,000 and are now mortgage free. Phoebe and Luke from Auckland , New Zealand constructed their stunning off-grid home all by themselves while still at university. In the house tour video, posted by the YouTube channel ""Living Big in A Tiny House""!, the pair show off their completely off-grid cosy home. The former students was fearful of the ""scary Auckland housing market"" and knew that they couldn't afford without a huge mortgage. With little experience, the young couple set about building their DIY dream home, learning from others experiences with tiny homes. Now, they say the feeling is ""surreal"" to have their own place to call home and everything in total cost them £57,000 which is ""much cheaper"" than anything on the market. Built on top of a hill their friend's farmland, their new house has views for miles over spoilt countryside, helped by plenty of windows that drench light into the property. And bills remain cheap as they use solar panels to power everything in their new home. The house is designed to be open-plan and has french doors that lead out to decking to emphasis the indoor-outdoor living. The feature they seem to be most proud of is the outdoor bathtub, which Phoebe says is ""very nice at night time under the stars"". ""We absolutely love the privacy, the native bush, all the birds and wildlife, it's really amazing,"" she says. They've cleverly fitted a big sink, fridge, stove, counter tops and storage into their mini kitchen. ""Nothing is lost or wasted, it was really important for us,"" she says referring to how they maximised the space inside. ""It's more than enough for two people."" Luke adds: ""I couldn't ask for much more. ""The reason why we built a tiny home is to put all our money and time into something that we could call our own at the end of the day."" It comes as a woman built a tiny home at the bottom of her garden and turned it into a ""very lucrative"" side-hustle. Gill, an almost-retiree from Australia , designed her own adorable house-on-wheels, which is always fully-booked by people who want a taste of the tiny house living . Meanwhile, a grandmother has told how she will have to tear down her daughter's tiny home after a neighbour reported her to the council.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/couldn-t-afford-buy-house-833433853.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/couldn-t-afford-buy-house-833433805.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiny2.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiny4.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiny3.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiny.png","We couldn’t afford to buy a house so we built a tiny home – it cost £57,000 and we live mortgage-free",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23139113/couldnt-afford-tiny-home-mortgage-free-new-zealand/
"A WOMAN went completely off-grid and built a hole in the ground that she turned into a cosy cave home. The mystery lady showed off her survival skills by creating a hidden escape using only her bare hands and a piece of sharpened metal on a stick. A video , posted to YouTube by Primitive Survival Life, shows the incredible transformation into the little home. Living in a hole isn't for everyone and this one certainly doesn't look comfortable - but it provides a cosy space for shelter from the weather and a place to cook and sleep. Working effectively and meticulously, the woman digs an underground tunnel with steps down to an open-plan space. Above earth, its near-impossible to spot after the lady expertly camouflages the entrance with nearby plants and grass. The only giveaway is when she lights a fire and smoke billows out through a makeshift chimney. Despite tiny homes becoming all the rage - this woman took it new levels by creating hers completely cost-free using whatever natural materials she could get her hands on. There are shelves, seats and even two fireplaces to provide heat and light. She even shows her fans how she cooks meat skewers and steak on the hot embers. A handmade bamboo hatch works as a front door to be opened and closed. The survival expert is not the only person who is swapping more usual accommodation to live in a cave - an estimated 40million people live in caves across the globe. The rock provides excellent insulation, allowing the home to remain cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The cave-life is particularly proving popular with Brits who are rushing to buy the unusual properties across Europe. It comes after a young couple who couldn't afford a home decided to invest in a cave in France . Over 12 months, Alexia Lamoreux and Lotte van Riel laboured inside their £1 home to make it liveable, and the total renovations only came to £30,000. Meanwhile, a homeless man carved a cave out of a cliff and now has incredible sea views. Nissim Kahlon, 77, created a remarkable structure filled with tunnels, mosaics, and winding staircases out of beachside sandstone cliffs in Israel . Meanwhile, a woman caused a stir after showing off a cave her partner built at the bottom of their garden - and its no beachside escape. And this man built another unexpected shelter - an igloo in his garden.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hidden6.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hidden3.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ve-got-keen-eyes-spot-833445710.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833478371.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hidden2.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ve-got-keen-eyes-spot-833445712.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ve-got-keen-eyes-spot-833445706.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ve-got-keen-eyes-spot-833445711.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hole6.png",I dug a hole in the ground to live off-grid & turned it into a cosy cave home – you’ve got to have keen eyes to spot it,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23139833/hole-ground-off-grid-cosy-cave-home-spot-it/
"A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE stooge for Vladimir Putin has been found dead in his office in the latest mystery death to hit Russia. Anton Cherepennikov, 40, a key figure in Putin's spying operation, was discovered at the property in Moscow . His cause of death according to Russian media was ""cardiac arrest"" despite there being no post-mortem. And one of his close pals has gone public insisting that he does not believe this is the case. Cherepennikov was seen as a sinister figure amongst the Russian elite - who have developed a habit of dropping dead. He was the owner of most systems for wiretapping phones and storing internet traffic in Russia. It comes after the death of billionaire oligarch Igor Kudryakov - a former government official and wealthy businessman. And this means two high-profile figures linked to Putin's regime have been confirmed dead in just 48 hours. Before any post-mortem, media accounts quickly stated he had died from “cardiac arrest”. This was immediately treated with suspicion. Cherepennikov's longtime friend Vasily Polonsky insisted: “I do not believe [he died of] cardiac arrest.” “The exact cause of the entrepreneur's death will be determined later,” reported Baza media outlet. “He was an absolutely key tool in Putin’s repression,” said an opposition source. “His assassination cannot be ruled out as the security apparatus becomes desperate due to the failing war."" His Citadel holding company was described as “almost a monopoly on the wiretapping of Russians”. This followed draconian laws under which telecom operators must store audio recordings of all calls and text messages for six months, and Internet internet traffic for a month. His business worked hand in glove with Putin’s feared FSB security service, and its employees included key figures trained by the counterintelligence service - and their close relatives. Heavy smoker Cherepennikov was considered the key playing behind SORM - the 'the system of technical means to ensure the functions of operational-search activities’, or total wiretapping in Russia. His success in acting as the state’s electronic snooper meant a profit of £172 million for his operation, it was reported. Cherepennikov was seen as close to his “idol”, Kremlin-friendly oligarch Alisher Usmanov, formerly a shareholder of Arsenal football club in London. The web sleuth studied at prestigious  Bauman Moscow State Technical University and Moscow State University of Civil Engineering. He went into business initially importing Blackberry phones, and selling computers and printers. He played the computer game Counter-Strike and poker. The shadowy businessman was described as “competitive” and a gambler. Cherepennikov divorced his first wife who he met on a dating site, blaming his compulsive working habits for 15 hours a day. He married again, to a woman named Anna, whom he also met on a dating site. A string of suspicious deaths have hit Russia since the months leading up to Putin’s ill-judged war in Ukraine. Dozens of military figures, government officials, and business people have all died in sudden and often unexplained deaths. Some can likely be chalked up to genuine health problems and suicides, but many have raised questions. Putin is understood to rule a murderous regime happy to kill anyone that gets in its way or who is not longer of use to them. Vlad has been branded as running a modern-day version of the mafia gang ""Murder Inc"" .

"FURIOUS locals living in a Spanish coastal town overrun with nightmare tourists are ready to go to war after a disgusting viral video. Sickening footage showed the moment a Dutch tourist defecated onto a passed-out partygoer as he slept on the promenade in Arenal, Majorca . The sick prank is the latest grim act to have infuriated residents who have been forced to ensure a series of hellish summers in the once-quaint town of Arenal. It was reportedly filmed only a few days ago and has already inspired plenty of hatred in the community against who they see as turning their home into an open toilet. And the video has already been dubbed a new low for the resort town. Local media has carried reports describing how the town ""cannot sink any lower""  and reported how residents are begging for the police to step in. The newly popular resort suffers from an influx of troublemaker tourists each year, with boozy Brits usually being dubbed the ""worst"" of them all. Arenal sits between Palma and Llucmajor and is on the opposite side of the bay to its more infamous neighbour Magaluf . ""This is the sickest thing I’ve ever seen,"" the caption on the widely shared video reads. Residents infuriated by the disgusting clip have now been left at breaking point. Alain Carbonell, vice-president of the Arenal Neighbourhood Association, told local paper Ultima Hora: ""This is what is happening here. ""They are very wild people. They’re very drunk, drugged and full of brutal aggressiveness. ""They’re like the mafia as far as we’re concerned."" Last month, Carbonell accused tourists, particularly Germans , of turning Arenal into the home of 48-hour benders. He claimed the raucous holidaymakers were refusing to pay for hotels to instead go on marathon drinking sessions and end up sleeping on the street or beach. Carbonell told The Sun Online that the nightmare tourists who descend on the town from March to September make life ""insufferable"". ""Now Palma Beach has been 'Magalufised'. The Germans now do exactly what the Brits do. ""They throw themselves from balconies, they keep mixing their drinks all day, and use drugs. As a result, they fall asleep in people's gardens, and they are being robbed. ""There a people vomiting all over the place while others use rubbish bins as toilets. ""After partying they go through people's houses, trying to find their hotels, they shout, they sing, they destroy traffic signs. ""They are like crazy, it's insufferable. ""We all live off tourism but we don't want this kind of tourism."" David Servera, president of the Residents' Association of nearby Llucmajor moaned his beloved home was going down the drain. David explained that the streets are filled with rubbish and faeces overnight and despite being cleaned the following day they become dirty again in a matter of hours. He told The Sun: ""We know it's a tourist area and understand there's going to be noise but there are things you don't expect. ""We are a traditional village but in the past 15 years, many people have left because of the tourists. ""Arenal is in a great location, it has a beautiful beach and it could be better."" He added: ""Authorities need to do more to help us raise the level of tourism and put a stop to 24-hour tourists that come here for a night.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/danrd0-tourists-watch-soccer-match-826142800.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/beach-sarenal-bay-palma-mass-826142796.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-shows-faeces-face-tourist-833541615.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kg3m2t-tourist-sleeping-beach-arenal-826306825.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KH-MAP-MAJORCAN-HOTSPOT-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boozy-brits-poo-gardens-hellish-826312632.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c93hcj-crowd-young-people-dancing-833457907.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sarenal-mallorca-balearic-islands-spain-833456940.jpg",We live in an idyllic town being ruined by tourists – they have hit a new low with most DISGUSTING act we’ve ever seen,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23140596/idyllic-majorca-town-ruined-tourists-disgusting-act/
"BRIT holidaymakers heading to a popular destination have been warned this face another week of sweltering temperatures. The mercury is expected to hit highs of 45C over the coming days as government agencies urged people to stay in the shade. Greek authorities today issued a new warning for the weekend as the country continues to bake in roasting sunshine. UK Foreign Office officials continue to urge any Brits jetting out for the summer holidays to follow all the health guidance. And new advice from the General Secretariat of Civil Protection and National Meteorological Service has urged tourists and locals to take care. It is predicted temperatures will continue to blast in the low to mid-40s over the weekend. The heat will then drop away and then climb again next week with a ""third thermal flare-up"". Civil protection officials are urging people be ""particularly careful"" and to take ""self-protection measures"" against the warmth. They urge everyone in Greece to stay in ""cool and shady places"" while using air-con and fans. Officials urge people to avoid sunbathing and walking outside - and if you must, make sure you wear a hat, sunglasses and light clothes. People should eat light meals with fruits and vegetables, and drink plenty of water and juice. Booze should also be avoided, along with high-fat foods. ""Special care is recommended for babies and young children, as well as the elderly and those with chronic diseases to protect them from high temperatures,"" said Greek officials. Some tourist destinations - such as the Acropolis in Athens - are also expected to close during the hottest parts of the day. The temperature is forecast to hit highs of 45C in the region of Thessaly on Sunday. But then there will be respite as the temperature then is predicted to ""drop significantly"" Thursday. The period of high temperatures has seen Greece also hit by dozens of wildfires - with planes and firefighters drafted in from other European nations to beat the blazes Panagiotis Giannopoulos, a meteorologist with state broadcaster ERT, said: ""Athens is going to have temperatures above 40C for six to seven days, through to the end of July,"" Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken. The current bout of heat belongs to a weather system originating in North Africa - an anticyclone dubbed ""Charon"". Charon refers to a character from Ancient Greek mythology - and follows on the heels of another high-pressure weather system, Cerberus, responsible for last week's sweltering heat.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/country-face-one-heatwave-episode-833474377.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-temperatures-expected-climb-44-833469833.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/men-help-firefighter-try-extinguish-832759105.jpg",Urgent holiday warning for popular Brit destination as temperatures to hit 45C and tourists warned not to sunbathe,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23140914/holiday-warning-temperatures-hit-destination/
"ADRIFT, alone and growing thin - Tim Shaddock was lost at sea for two months and believed he was done for. The real-life castaway, 51, somehow survived the mercy of currents in a 30ft storm-battered catamaran and has now revealed the habits that kept him alive. Accompanied by his stray dog Bella, Tim left Mexico in April and were headed on a 3,728-mile voyage to French Polynesia when their boat was ravaged by a storm. The Australian sailor's electronics, navigation system, sail and cooking equipment had been destroyed and they were stranded 2000km out to sea. In a pure miracle, a helicopter scouting far out in the Eastern Pacific for a school of tuna instead scouted Tim. It alerted its nearby deep-sea fishing trawler and the pair were rescued. A gaunt, shaggy-bearded Tim and his beloved pet were hauled to safety on July 12. How a former IT specialist survived such an ordeal baffled the world, but a now-freshly shaven Tim has explained how he did it. The Aussie said his survival instincts kicked in and he made sure to always keep himself busy and his mind focused. He occupied himself with fixing things on the boat and devising creative DIY hacks to catch more rainwater. ""A lot of sushi"" was also central to keeping himself and Bella alive over many weeks, and Tim spent lots of the time during the day fishing. To avoid the fatigue and feelings of isolation, the castaway sought solace in meditation and taking time to write in his journal. Swimming also became a kind of therapy for Tim and feeding Bella each day brought him a much-needed purpose that stopped him falling into despair. Andrés Zamorano, the pilot on the helicopter that first spotted Tim, believes the obligation he felt to saving Bella kept him going. The brave survivor equally credits his Mexican street dog with his survival, stating that Bella was ""braver than I am"". Once back on dry land in Mexico, Tim told reporters: ""I'm feeling alright. I'm feeling a lot better than I was, I tell ya."" He reported that he felt ""in very good health"" but was in need of rest and ""good food"". In a heartbreaking turn, Tim was forced to leave Bella behind as he returned to Australia due its strict laws on the import of live animals. The canine who ""found"" him in Mexico has been adopted by one of the tuna crew, Genaro Rosales, who helped to save Tim's life.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-shaddock-left-mexico-aiming-832380255-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-provided-grupomar-atun-tuny-832433016.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-provided-grupomar-atun-tuny-832433033.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-provided-grupomar-atun-tuny-832433113.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-australian-sailor-dog-rescued-832592675-1.jpg",I was a real-life castaway left adrift at sea for two months with just my dog – these are the tricks I used to survive,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23141063/castaway-adrift-sea-months-dog-tim-shaddock-tricks-survive/
"A GLAMOROUS associate of the ""most violent"" faction of El Chapo's cartel has been extradited to the United States from Guatemala. Ana Gabriela Rubio Zea, 33, dubbed ""La Gaby"", is accused of money laundering and supplying fentanyl into the US for one of the most powerful criminal organisations in Mexico . The Gucci-loving suspected criminal was flown to New York alongside four other Guatemalan drug traffickers yesterday. The authorities say the wanted 33-year-old is part of a criminal network connected to the Sinaloa Cartel and El Chapo's ruthless offspring known as Los Chapitos . Known as the cartel's most violent faction, Los Chapitos is accused of producing fentanyl in Mexico and trafficking it to the United States. The US authorities also accuse its collaborators of crimes including murder, torture, and money laundering. In America, La Gaby faces charges of conspiracy to possess and distribute 400g of fentanyl in the US and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Ana's wanted poster had offered a reward up to $1million [£778,000] for her capture. According to investigations, the blonde Guatemalan played a crucial role in purchasing 25kg of a chemical from China that is used to produce fentantl, allegedly on behalf of the Sinaloa Cartel. After the chemical arrived in Mexico, it was processed before being transported to the US and other countries. Mexican clients reportedly relied on La Gaby because she ensured the products' safe delivery, passing the drugs through customs without detection by the authorities. She often concealed the chemicals in food containers and wrappings, making it difficult for them to be discovered. The US warned they are ""going after the entire [Sinloa] network"" as part of a crackdown on opioids. The Los Chapitos faction is made up Joaquin Guzman Lopez , 36, Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar , 37, and Ivan Guzman Salazar , 40. In April, they were all accused of fronting the criminal empire centred around drug trafficking and torture - including running a huge fentanyl supply operation into the US. US prosecutors accuse El Chapo's sons of horrifically torturing their rivals , including allegedly tested their drugs on captives before inflicting the most appalling torture and depravity imaginable. The brothers are also said to have fed them alive to their pet tigers. Their infamous father and former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán is currently serving a life sentence in a supermax US prison. The trio remain at large and continue to run the organisation. The Drug Enforcement Administration have even put a $10million bounty on Alfredo's head in the hopes of tracking him down. Their sibling Ovidio Guzman Lopez , 33, is already behind bars after being arrested on January 5 after a massive shootout that left at least 29 dead. The Guatemalan Ministry of the Interior said that five accused individuals were handed over by special forces to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). They were all arrested this year in various round-ups of the suspected members of the notorious drug cartel. In a statement, they said: ""Alias 'La Gaby' was detained on 17th March while travelling in a vehicle on Landivar Boulevard in zone 15 of the capital. ""She is wanted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute 400 grams or more of fentanyl with the intention, knowledge, and reasonable belief that the fentanyl would be illegally imported into the aforementioned North American country.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ana-gabriela-gaby-rubio-zea-833490018.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ana-gabriela-gaby-rubio-zea-833490015.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Newsflash-BlondePartner-01.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Newsflash-BlondePartner-05.jpg",Gucci-loving El Chapo cartel smuggler ‘La Gaby’ arrested by drug cops after $1million reward placed on her head,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23141584/gucci-el-chapo-cartel-smuggler-la-gaby-arrested/
"BRIT tourists have been urged to evacuate parts of Rhodes as an out-of-control wildfire sweeps across the Greek holiday island. Up to 19,000 locals and tourists have been forced to flee in the biggest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen as the fires spin out of control on the popular island. Greek authorities are saying it is the largest evacuation mission that has ever taken place in the country as they battle with the massive inferno. They said that 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels. The flames have burned for nearly a week on the island after Greece was battered by an extended spell of extreme heat that has made it challenging to contain the blaze. Extraordinary scenes show columns of people carrying their luggage and children while trying to escape. The fire has scorched swathes of forest and made its way into villages and towns since breaking out in a mountainous area on Tuesday. The blaze spread to at least three hotels in the seaside village of Kiotari which caught fire on Saturday. British Embassy officials in Athens urged Brits to leave the area on Saturday evening - as holidays and flights to Rhodes continue to be cancelled. And the battle is expected to worsen today, with more whipping winds blasting across the island and driving the flames. ""The wind is expected to become more intense from 12 to 5 pm, without excluding the possibility that could happen earlier,"" said fire department spokesman Vassilis Vathrakoyiannis. “This is not a fire that will be over tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,” he added. “It’ll be troubling us for days.” Yiannis Artopios, a fire service spokesman, said: “The focus now is to contain two major fronts in the south and central part of the island. ""The regions hit so far may account for less than 10 per cent of the island’s hotel infrastructure, but if left unchecked the blazes can threaten the remaining 90 per cent.” Although hotter, drier and windy summers have brought more fires in recent years, it has not been confirmed how the wildfire first started. Artopios said authorities were questioning suspected arsonists. “Fires are not sparked on their own,” he told Skai TV. “They are triggered by the human hand, be it intentionally or not. ""We currently have several people being questioned in connection with their probable involvement.” The fires during the night reached the village of Laerma and were burning houses and a church there, while many hotels were damaged by the flames that on some occasions reached the sea. Over 250 firefighters, backed by aircraft water-bombers and reinforcements from Slovakia, battled three fronts on Sunday. They are setting up firebreaks to prevent flames from spreading to a dense forest or threatening more residential areas. However, high winds forecast for Sunday are expected to hamper firefighters' battle to contain a blaze burning out of control on the Greek island. Fleeing Brits have spent the night in makeshift camps across the island - with young kids forced to sleep on mattresses in classrooms and gyms. The British ambassador to Greece said the Foreign Office had sent a ""rapid deployment team"" to help UK tourists who were among the thousands forced to flee. Another British tourist who was forced to escape from the fires, described it feeling like ""the end of the world"". Londoner Ian Morrison was staying in the Kiotari area when he watched the sea become ""black with soot"" and ash was falling on people's heads. After walking for miles and eventually hitching a ride to Gennadi beach, he told Sky News : ""Over the next few hours, the amount of people in that area just increased and increased. ""Then as light fell, people became increasingly anxious about how they were going to get out from this. ""It was literally like the end of the world,"" he said as flames threatened to chase him down. Are you in Rhodes right now? Tell us your story! Contact the foreign desk at: iona.cleave@the-sun.co.uk or worldnews@the-sun.co.uk British holidaygoer James Beale was on his way to his hotel with his partner yesterday when their minibus was stopped and held for almost six hours. ""The whole skyline became covered in smoke, fire engines and police blasted past and suddenly we couldn't see anything,"" he told The Sun. ""The driver didn't speak English and we had no idea what was happening."" They never made it to their hotel and instead have been sleeping on a sheet on the floor of a hotel as they wait for a flight out of the chaos. ""We're not in a bad place like other people, but no one knows anything and Tui is just telling us to sit and wait,"" he added. Mum-of-three Helen Tonks, of Manchester, flew into Rhodes on Saturday night with her three daughters and husband ahead of a two-week sunshine break. She told The Sun: “There was absolutely no communication whatsoever. We got out here and were told our hotel was among those evacuated. ""They put us on a coach and brought us to a school in Rhodes old town. There are hundreds of us here. We’ve been put up in makeshift dorms in classrooms. ""Dozens are sleeping on mattresses on the basketball court in the gymnasium.” Jet2 has now cancelled all flights and holidays that were due to depart to Rhodes today. The statement added: ""We will fly those five empty aircraft to Rhodes with no customers onboard, so that we can bring customers back to the UK on their scheduled flight."" Tui - who have 40,000 tourists in Rhodes, 7,800 of which are impacted by the fires - have also now cancelled all their flights and holidays to the island up to and including Tuesday July 25. Coastguard vessels and more than 20 private boats took part in an operation to evacuate swathes of tourists and local residents late into the night on Saturday. PE teacher Dan Jones, of Torquay, said: “We are safe for now. The scariest moment in my entire life. ""After wading into the sea and climbing on a fishing trawler, we are away from danger."" It comes as Greece continues to face high temperatures - with forecasts of up to 45C going into next week . The country also experienced an ""insidious and dangerous"" heat blast earlier this month with temperatures also soaring to 40C. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year.

"UKRAINE has shown off the UK's mighty Challenger 2 tanks in action for its showdown with Vladimir Putin. Fourteen of the British tanks arrived in Ukraine in March earlier this year, with suggestions they would spearhead the counter-offensive. The Ukrainian military has been secretive about the movements of the Challenger 2 tanks. But a new video of the tanks in action has been released by the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The footage shows multiple camouflaged Challenger 2s being driven through muddy terrain and firing shells as part of a training exercise. The tank's turret can also be seen swivelling as it travels at speed through sand and huge puddles. Also among the clips is the tank hiding close to a treeline and releasing a swathe of smoke as it travels along a dirt track. In the video, one of the soldiers said: ""The impressions are great, both in training and in action."" No location was given for the training exercise and it remains unclear if the tanks have been deployed to the frontline Challenger 2s have been praised by Ukrainian tankers as ""diamonds"" and ""beasts"", with crews travelling to the UK earlier this year to train with them on in a three-week course on Salisbury Plain. The 1,200bhp tank's 120mm cannon can be armed with armour-piercing shells that fly towards the enemy at 4,250mph. It can also be armed with high explosive bunker-busting shells that can blow up light enemy vehicles or entrenched positions. The Challenger 2 can carry up to 1,800 litres of diesel, giving them an average 341 miles range at a speed of 37mph. If needed, additional fuel can be sprayed on the hot engine to produce a smoke screen, providing cover for the tank. The tank driver controls the vehicle with two sticks from an almost lying down position. On each side are five smoke grenade dischargers, with can be fired as a smoke screen to the front, protecting against laser beam-riding missiles. It also has a chain gun spitting out 7.62mm rounds to rip through soft-skinned vehicles such as trucks, or dismounted infantry. It comes as huge explosions today rocked Russian-occupied Crimea after suspected Ukrainian drones targeted an ammunition depot. It is the third daring attack believed to have been masterminded by Ukraine on the annexed region this week in a humiliating blow to Vladimir Putin. Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-installed leader of the region, reported the drone attack had succeeded in hitting an ammunition depot and there were no known casualties.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ukraine-shows-off-britain-s-833525114.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gfadgfdgfdshgfdshg.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gfdsgfdhgfdhgdjfdjf-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gfshghjddhgfh-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ukraine-shows-off-britain-s-833525121.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ukraine-shows-off-britain-s-833525120.jpg",Ukraine shows off Britain’s mighty Challenger 2 tanks in action as they head for the frontline to face down Putin,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23142814/ukraine-britains-challenger-2-tanks-frontline-putin/
"THIS is the expandable tiny house that can triple in size within just ten minutes. The ""Expandable Container House"" can be folded out from a portable cabin-styled unit into a two-bedroom home. Created by China -based Moneybox Modular Housing, a video has revealed how the expansion process takes just a matter of minutes. Initially just a single oblong-shaped container with a front door, the house folds out from the sides to form an additional two equally-sized rooms. When expanded, the second room contains four windows, along with a shower room and mirrors. On the other side of the main compartment, a third room can be opened out to create additional space. The rooms are then simply bolted and hooked together, with the total assembly time taking just ten minutes. Furniture can be added to the rooms to suit, with the video showing a dining room table and chairs in one of the rooms. The house uses a light steel structure, making it easier to move around and assemble. The portable home has been designed to be eco-friendly, with the firm specialising in portable buildings. In the video, five people can be seen assembling the home.

Religious and other leaders addressed nearly 15,000 demonstrators — mostly women — in Churachandpur, India . They also called for the sacking of Biren Singh, the top elected official in the north-eastern state of Manipur where more than 130 people have been killed since violence between ethnic groups erupted in May. A video, showing the naked women surrounded by young men who grope their genitals and drag them to a field, triggered outrage when it was shared on social media on Wednesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the incident had ""shamed India"" and that ""no guilty will be spared"". ""I assure the nation, the law will take its course with all its might. What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,"" he said. The violence depicted in the video was emblematic of the near-civil war in Manipur, a state of 3.7 million tucked in the mountains near India's border with Myanmar . At least 130 have been killed and 60,000 have been displaced after ethnic clashes broke out between the Meitei and Kuki communities in May. The two warring factions have also formed armed militias and isolated villages are regularly raked with gunfire.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/students-federation-india-participate-torch-833479225.jpg,"15,000 protesters demand arrests after women paraded naked in the street by armed mob in India",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23144125/india-protesters-naked-sit-in-women-streets/
"THIS is the shocking moment an oblivious teenager is knocked over after unknowingly stepping in front of a tram. The young woman, 18, was wearing headphones as she stepped onto a crossing as a tram approached. She strolled in front of the tram before being knocked to the floor as it came to a braking halt. The near-death incident took place in northern Turkish state of Samsun. The woman told Turkish media: ""I put the headset to distract myself, but I almost died because of it."" The incident took place in September last year but has since resurfaced on social media. A security camera showed her looking in the opposite direction as the tram approached, before noticing it as it was just inches away. She attempted to run out of the way, but was clipped by the tram and fell to the floor. A number of concerned members of the public then rushed to her aid, but she did not suffer any serious injuries. The train driver said in a statement: ""The accident occurred around 08:00 in the morning, while I was approaching Paruthan station in the direction of Line 1, I applied the handbrake, while the young woman was passing without looking to her right or left."" She added: ""I sounded the siren, however, when the girl did not hear me, I applied the emergency brake, which is a strong brake.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocking-moment-oblivious-teen-wearing-833537703.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocking-moment-oblivious-teen-wearing-833537719.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocking-moment-oblivious-teen-wearing-833537720.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocking-moment-oblivious-teen-wearing-833537716.jpg",Shocking moment oblivious teen wearing headphones is knocked to ground after stepping onto track in front of tram,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23144031/shocking-moment-teen-headphones-track-train/
"AT least 11 people have been killed after a barred drinker set fire to a pub, cops say, The suspected arson attack, in the Mexican city of San Luis Rio Colorado , tore through the popular venue on Saturday. Cops allege a drunk man was thrown out of the Beer House Cantina bar after harassing women. But it is claimed he then returned with a Molotov cocktail to start the inferno. Prosecutors in the state of Sonora claims a young man threw the make-shift bomb towards the entrance at around 1.30am, before being arrested by police. A statement from the Sonora Attorney General's Office read: ""According to versions (from) several witnesses, the person with a young, male appearance was disrespecting women in that bar and was expelled."" Of the 11 victims, four were women and one was just 17-years-old, according to the state attorney general Gustavo Romulo Salas. Another person who tragically died was said to be from the US and most likely had dual Mexican citizenship. There were four more people injured who required hospital treatment after the terrifying blast. Santos Gonzalez, the mayor of the city, said at a press conference that the suspect had been arrested after officers tracked down his car. A spokesman from Yuma Regional Medical Center (YRMC) said: ""Our hearts go out to the victims and families affected by his tragedy.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/picture-released-la-tremenda-cosa-833519387.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/forensic-technicians-prepare-work-scene-833536836.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/view-shows-part-scene-man-833537984.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/forensic-technician-works-scene-man-833537992.jpg",At least 11 people killed and four injured after barred drinker ‘set fire to pub’ as cops arrest suspect,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/worldnews/23144552/mexico-bar-fire-saturday-killed-eleven-people/
"A FORMER KGB spy who trained at the same top military academy as Putin knows all too well what a master manipulator he is. Aliia Roza, 38, now a life coach, said Putin has ""brainwashed"" the Russian population using techniques that the KGB instils ""in your DNA "". The mum-of-one believes Putin’s spy training is responsible for his rise to power - and underneath his infamous strongman image is a manipulative and intimidating operator. “He became so powerful from the techniques he learnt… I know them too, but then he started to use it against the moral good,"" Aliia told The Sun. ""Nothing has changed since communism. They say the Cold War has ended, but really it’s still on. ""He's manipulating the whole world saying that if they will not listen to him, he will start a nuclear war. It’s blackmail."" Carrying his KGB playbook with him , Putin's conquering of the divide and rule approach and masterful use of manipulation has never gone unnoticed. For decades, those skills thrived in the closed worlds of Soviet-era intelligence before being thrust onto the world stage when he took power in 2000. And his same ruthless spy techniques have persisted as he tries to maintain his iron-fist rule during Russia's most unstable period for years. ""It's in your DNA,"" Aliia said. The ex-agent described how Putin’s mass manipulation has helped to maintain the illusion of his control. “In that academy, they trained us and they teach us how to live this double life and how to build your brand so strong that people would believe you 100 per cent,” she previously told The Sun . “You've seen so many photos of Mr Putin riding the horse half-naked, diving to the bottom of the ocean, shooting from different kind of guns and acting like a superhero. ""It's such a similar brand to James Bond . Every Russian man wants to be like a James Bond. It's a brand. ""So Mr Putin for many, many years built that strong brand where people would worship him. And that's also one of the techniques of being a super special agent."" Aliia was born in the Soviet Union with a Second World War hero for a father who raised her ""for a bigger purpose"". It's almost like going to war and dying like a hero - that's how I felt From a young age, he trained her mentally and physically for a future role in the intelligence service, telling her ""you have to be strong like a soldier"". “I didn’t understand at the time what was happening - I was too young,"" Aliia said. At 18, she was shipped off to a KGB military academy reserved only for the sons and daughters of high-ranking officials - the very same programme that Putin graduated in 1975. “I was selected with four other girls out of 350 based on physical conditions, appearance and intelligence for a secretive training programme,"" she said. “I was raised to be the best."" It was there that Aliia learnt the art of seduction, influence and manipulation - including how to interest a target , make them ""addicted"" to you and then programme them “to do what you want”. ""So it's all about psychological things, neuro-linguistic programming, how the brain works, all thrown together with sex techniques,"" she said. After she graduated, she joined the FSB - the KGB’s modern successor which Putin was formerly in charge of - and said she was tasked with infiltrating drug and human trafficking gangs. “When you are raised in a patriotic, communist country you are willing to sacrifice your life and your body,"" she said. ""You think ‘I’m doing such a great thing’. It's almost like going to war and dying as a hero. That’s how I felt.” But things took a turn, she claims, when a high-ranking officer raped, abused and harassed her. ""I couldn’t say no, I couldn’t do anything,"" she said. After she rejected his advances, he sent her on a dangerous mission and allegedly blew her cover in revenge, Aliia claimed. Once exposed, she described being beaten half to death by the gang members before their leader - who she had been sent to honeytrap - saved her and helped her to flee Russia . “He knew that by saving my life, he would be sacrificing his,” she said. The ruthless thugs came after her and she hid from them in Turkey , Switzerland , Greece , France and Italy . Her faux lover was killed and eventually the Russian state took down the whole gang. The FSB continued to try to force her to return, she said, even finding her in Greece and threatening to take her one-year-old son from her. “As a mother. I didn’t want to deal with this s*** anymore, like I was done. I completely cleaned myself out from this brainwashing system,"" she said. “Then I started my public life."" Aliia moved to London and began infiltrating celebrity and exclusive circles - mingling with members of the royal family and fashion superstars. She now lives in LA with her teenage son and has an Instagram glittering with red carpet appearances, famous faces and words of wisdom for her followers. “The reason I live a public life and expose my face is because it’s almost my insurance and my son’s insurance,"" the mum said. “The more public I am, the more I can be free. Thank God, after 20 years - I can be free."" But the former spy insists it is possible to ""use these KGB techniques for good"". And despite living a retired life of luxury , Aliia wants to help Russians understand what's really happening in the Ukraine war . She said: ""You cannot just say, ‘Oh, you know what? Screw it. I just want to live my life and enjoy it and just travel the world'. ""I strongly disagree with the war. And that's why I started to speak out, because I was trained and raised to protect people."" I strongly disagree with the war. And that's why I started to speak out Back at home, she claims that plenty of Russians cannot really tell what’s happening, especially older people. They don’t know how to access non-state media, use a VPN or speak English. “They only know what's written in Russian, which is completely bulls***,"" she said. ""So, it is part of how they manipulate the masses through the media. “Knowledge is your main weapon… that's why these are secret techniques. [Spy agencies] would never want it to be public, because it’s a power. ""And that's why I'm giving this to people, especially women, so women can be empowered. “Because I was abused and harassed and I was under male dominance for a very long time. I feel it's my mission and it's my job to educate and share this knowledge with women."" She added: ""I'm standing for peace and this is my choice and thank God now I live in America, where I can speak openly and freely. “I chose freedom and I chose life.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/john-chapple-us-sun-reuse-719448303.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aliia-roza-832781338.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aliia-roza-832781334.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/former-russian-spy-aliia-roza-719630483.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Snm91Tuq.jpeg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aliia-roza-attends-il-signore-832758188.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiktok-influencer-oli-london-aliia-714608703.jpg",I’m an ex-KGB spy who trained at the same military academy as Putin – I know how he thinks and he’s a master manipulator,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23107769/kgb-spy-trained-putin-manipulative-madman-aliia-roza/
"FOR just a short window one of the world's most stunning yet lethal wonders became accessible. Canadian explorer George Kourounis was one of the few who were able to - and dared to - enter the beautiful but deadly crystal cave in Mexico . The treacherous cavern, concealed 1,000ft below the ground, is filled with enormous crystals capable of killing visitors in a matter of minutes. Anchored to the walls of the blistering hot cave are hundreds of otherworldly crystals that have grown uninterrupted for at least half a million years. The dazzling glass-like shards deep beneath the Sierra de Naica Mountain in the heart of Chihuahua are up to 36ft long and weigh up to a staggering 55 tonnes. George, 53, told The Sun it was the most amazing place he had ever visited - a tall order considering the wild places he has graced around the globe. He said: ""It is fascinating, it really is. I was one of the few people who had the privilege of going inside that cave years ago when it was still accessible. ""The opportunity is now lost but it is like going into another planet. ""The air temperature is so unbearable - it is so hot and so humid that the air just hits you in the face like a hammer. ""Even with special chilled air respirators and ice-filled suits, we could only go in for around 40 minutes at a time."" Although equipped with the assets to make it the perfect tourist hotspot, the cave has all the makings of a death trap. The air is acidic and temperatures can hit sweltering highs of 58C with humidity levels close to 100 per cent. But even while wearing heat-protection suits and breathing apparatus, visitors can only tolerate the cave's conditions for around 15 to 60 minutes before likely losing consciousness. George added: ""You look around and it's like Superman's fortress of solitude. All these giant crystals made it like being on an alien planet. ""It was just so beautiful but every cell in your body is just screaming at you to leave because you overheat so fast in that extreme environment with the heat and humidity. ""But that's what makes it even more beautiful because you know your time is so limited in there. That makes it really special."" The spectacular yet perilous cavern remained one of Earth's secrets for thousands of years despite the neighbouring Naica Mine being worked for centuries. Two unsuspecting miners stumbled across the natural marvel - now named Giant Crystal Cave - in 2000 while excavating a new tunnel for a mining company. Towering above them were endless luminous milky-white crystals - some of the largest ever discovered. But these jagged crystals did not achieve their monumental form overnight. Scientists who risked their lives by venturing into the cave believe it could have taken between 500,000 and 900,000 years for them to grow. An uprising of magma millions of years ago forced hot, mineral-rich waters into the cavern, which spans as wide as a football pitch and as high as two-storey building. The gypsum minerals packed in the water, coupled with a magma chamber below the grotto acting like a cooker, provided the perfect condition for the crystals to form. A steady heat was maintained for hundreds of thousands of years - causing the gypsum in the water to transform into selenite crystals. The lethal translucent beams now measure up to 36ft long and many are even wide enough to be walked along. They are too hot for a bare hand to touch and are razor-sharp yet as soft as human fingernails. In 2017, biologists made the astounding discovery of a life form trapped inside the crystals estimated to be around 50,000 years old. A team of NASA microbiologists found the microbes - which are too small to be seen without a microscope - lurking within the fluid in the shards. Researchers believe the microbes are able to live off manganese, iron and other metallic elements present in the crystals. Announcing the remarkable find at the American Association for the Advancement of Science that year, Penelope Boston - chief of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute - described the microbes as ""super life"". But it is unlikely the cave will ever be explored again as it reflooded in recent years after mining operations ceased. The cave's accessibility was dependent on the mine's water pumps, which were stopped in 2017 - allowing groundwater to refill the cave. For two almost decades, the crystals were exposed to air, but now resubmerged in water it is believed they may have started growing again.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/george-kourounis-822195822.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/george-kourounis-822195722.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/george-kourounis-822195723.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/george-kourounis-822195825.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/naica-crystal-cave-mexico-beautiful-809448227.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/naica-crystal-cave-mexico-beautiful-809448225.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NINTCHDBPICT000822166575.jpg",I explored the killer crystal cave – your body screams at you to get out as the 58C heat can kill you within minutes,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22554126/explored-deadly-crystal-cave-kill/
"A REALITY star used his own speedboat to evacuate scores of holidaymakers off beaches as they fled the ""out of control"" fires raging in Rhodes. James Kafetzis shared footage of terrified tourists and locals clambering to safety onboard his boat as the sky above them filled with ash and smoke on the popular Greek island. In a big red speedboat, the Rhodes local helped in the evacuation of those that had fled from burning villages and hotels and raced to the beach to try and escape the fast-moving wildfires. The footage shows swaths of people lining the beach loaded up with children and luggage as others climb up the bow of his boat. The previous star of Greece's Survivor TV show declared it was an ""SOS"" situation on Instagram as he tried to alert the world to the fiery hell raging on his home island. ""This is out of control,"" the brave sailor said. ""We are evacuating the world under Mitsis Rodos Maris, my red boat is loading from the beach and taking them to other ships that take them to Kalathos to get on buses to Rhodes."" Earlier today, a horror video surfaced that showed the desperate escape of hundreds of terrified tourists last night who were stranded on a beach after running from the flames. The footage showed masses of exhausted-looking people hoping to be loaded onto the next boat by the Red Cross. Greek authorities are saying it is the largest evacuation mission that has ever taken place in the country as they battle with the inferno. Over 19,000 people have been forced to move after being threatened by the wildfires, including more than 2,500 ferried straight off beaches. A British dad-of-four has described his family's hell as they fled the Rhodes inferno in the dead of night . PE Teacher Daniel Jones had to wade into the ocean neck deep to get his young family onto a pleasure boat to escape the flames. He described it as: ""The scariest moment in my entire life."" ""It has been a nightmare, our holiday has been ruined, our kids traumatised,"" he told The Sun. ""There was still a lot of confusion, it was madness. There were no reps or anyone to tell us what was happening. ""There was a moment where you could clearly see the flames moving closer but there were no boats to escape, I felt completely powerless to protect my family."" Coastguard vessels and dozens of private boats took part in a rescue of over 2,000 tourists and locals from beaches on Saturday late into the night. British Embassy officials in Athens have urged all Brits to evacuate. The flames have burned for nearly a week on Rhodes as Greece has been battered by an extended spell of extreme heat that has made it challenging to contain the fast-spreading blaze. More than 250 firefighters and volunteers fought the blaze during the night, while the air support started early on Sunday as the fires spread. Extraordinary scenes yesterday showed columns of people carrying their luggage and children on-foot trying to escape. The fire has scorched swathes of forest and burned down buildings and hotels since breaking out in a mountainous area on Tuesday. The blaze spread to at least three hotels in the seaside village of Kiotari which caught fire on Saturday. And the battle has been expected to worsen today, with more whipping winds blasting across the island and fanning the flames. ""The wind is expected to become more intense from 12 to 5 pm, without excluding the possibility that could happen earlier,"" said fire department spokesman Vassilis Vathrakoyiannis. “This is not a fire that will be over tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,” he added. “It’ll be troubling us for days.” The fires during the night reached the village of Laerma and were burning houses and a church there, while many hotels were damaged by the flames that on some occasions even reached the sea. Firefighters, backed by aircraft that dropped water, battled three fronts on Sunday, setting up firebreaks to prevent flames from spreading to a dense forest or threatening more residential areas. Fleeing Brits have spent the night in makeshift camps across the island - with young kids forced to sleep on the floor or on mattresses in classrooms and gyms. It comes as Greece continues to face high temperatures - with forecasts of up to 45C going into next week . The country also experienced an ""insidious and dangerous"" heat blast earlier this month with temperatures also soaring to 40C. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/situation-control-images-destruction-videos-833683260-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rescue3.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/66a9f24b-5a94-487c-a31f-8a18a1072b37.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VP-MAP-RHODES-v2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fgdshgfdhgfdgfdhfjjgkkhg.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/desperate-escape-terrifying-moment-rhodes-833625770.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-three-coastguard-boats-leading-833620046.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-mum-three-helen-tonks-833584817.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-wildfire-raging-control-five-833619973.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-shows-pine-trees-burning-833500218-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-fire-department-managed-put-833504517.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-shows-smoke-rising-burnt-833620055.jpg",I used my speedboat to rescue trapped tourists from beaches in Rhodes wildfires – the situation is out of control,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23145615/moment-rhodes-tourists-boats-beaches-darkness-wildfires/
"A BRITISH dad-of-four has described his family's hell as they fled the Rhodes inferno in the dead of night. PE Teacher Daniel Jones had to wade into the ocean neck deep to get his young family onto a pleasure boat to escape the flames that chased them. Daniel, 37, was holidaying with wife Hannah, 35, and their four kids, Ethel, 2, Oliver, 5, Albert, 7 and Rupert, 9, when they were evacuated from their luxury hotel at 10pm Saturday night. The family, from Exeter , Devon , was staying at the Atlantica Dreams Resort in Gennadi along with grandparents Shirley, 68, and Gary, 72,  when the sky turned orange and filled with smoke. Daniel told The Sun: ""We only arrived in Rhodes on Friday night, so Saturday was our first day by the pool. ""At around 12pm I looked up and the sun had disappeared and there was a long trail of smoke going on for miles. ""Eventually the whole hotel was shrouded in smoke, and there was an orange glow on the hillside. It was really eerie."" Daniel said over the course of the day hundreds of other holidaymakers arrived at their hotel having been evacuated from other resorts on the island. ""It was chaos, the lobby was like Heathrow airport. We packed our bags ready to leave but there was no communication from the tour operator about what we should do. ""Eventually an evacuation alarm sounded in the hotel and the manager said we all had to leave on foot. ""We just followed the crowds and walked into the night dragging our cases and my wife pushing a buggy. The kids were exhausted, upset and crying and there was hysteria, a sense of panic. ""At some point a TUI rep said there were six coaches coming to pick us up and told us to wait, but nothing came. It was the hotel manager who told us to keep walking for our own safety. ""Eventually we bumped into two men from the Red Cross who told us we had to go to the beach."" Daniel said there was 400 people stranded on the beach in the pitch black. It has been a nightmare, our holiday has been ruined and the kids traumatised ""There was still a lot of confusion, it was madness. There were no reps or anyone to tell us what was happening. ""There was a moment where you could clearly see the flames moving closer but there were no boats to escape, I felt completely powerless to protect my family."" Daniel said eventually some locals brought two pleasure cruisers into the shore and started loading people on. ""We were among the last to leave and I had to wade into the water with the kids. I was up to my neck and had to help them climb the ladder,"" he recalls. ""The kids were wearing pyjamas and were crying and soaked, it was awful, they were scared, it was heartbreaking to see."" Daniel said they sat on the boat for an hour and a half offshore while the captain worked out where he was going to take everybody. They were eventually taken up the coast to the north of the island before being bungled on to a minibus and taken to a local school with dozens of other families. ""The locals have been amazing, they've given us food and drinks, but now we just want to go home, the whole experience has been pretty traumatic, especially for the children."" Are you in Rhodes right now? Tell us your story! Contact us at: iona.cleave@the-sun.co.uk or worldnews@the-sun.co.uk Daniel and hundreds of other Brits are trying to arrange transport back to the UK. He added: ""It has been a nightmare, our holiday has been ruined and the kids traumatised. "" TUI are talking about taking us back to the hotel, but there's no way the kids will want to go back there after what's happened, we want to get home."" Up to 19,000 locals and tourists, including many Brits, have been forced to flee in the biggest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen as the fires on the popular island rage on. Local police said that 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels. Over 250 firefighters, helicopters, water-bombers and emergency rescuers are battling the worst blaze the country has ever experienced. The fire, which broke out in the mountains on Tuesday, has been aided by strong winds and is engulfing large parts of the central-southern parts of the island, burning down buildings and hotels. Yiannis Artopios, a fire service spokesman, said: “The focus now is to contain two major fronts in the south and central part of the island. ""The regions hit so far may account for less than 10 per cent of the island’s hotel infrastructure, but if left unchecked the blazes can threaten the remaining 90 per cent.” Although hotter, drier and windy summers have brought more fires in recent years, it has not been confirmed how the wildfire first started. Artopios said authorities were questioning suspected arsonists. “Fires are not sparked on their own,” he told Skai TV. “They are triggered by the human hand, be it intentionally or not. ""We currently have several people being questioned in connection with their probable involvement.” Extraordinary scenes show columns of tourists and locals travelling on foot and carrying their belongings and children down dusty roads. Busloads of fleeing Brits were taken to makeshift camps in gyms, schools and hotel conference centres where they staged overnight on the floor. British Embassy officials in Athens urged Brits to leave the area on Saturday evening - as flights to Rhodes continue to be cancelled. Horror footage emerged of scores of people with young children desperately waiting to be loaded onto boats in total darkness as fires burned in the background. Another British tourist who was forced to escape from the fires, described it feeling like ""the end of the world"". Londoner Ian Morrison was staying in the Kiotari area when he watched the sea become ""black with soot"" and ash fall on people's heads. After walking for miles and eventually hitching a ride to Gennadi beach, he told Sky News : ""Over the next few hours, the amount of people in that area just increased and increased. ""Then as light fell, people became increasingly anxious about how they were going to get out from this. ""It was literally like the end of the world,"" he said as flames threatened to chase him down. The fires have burned for nearly a week on the island as Greece has been hit by an extended spell of high temperatures and strong winds that has made it challenging to contain the blaze. And the battle is expected to worsen today, with more whipping winds blasting across the island and driving the flames. ""The wind is expected to become more intense from 12 to 5 pm, without excluding the possibility that could happen earlier,"" said fire department spokesman Vassilis Vathrakoyiannis. “This is not a fire that will be over tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,” he added. “It’ll be troubling us for days.” Firefighters, backed by aircraft water-bombers and reinforcements from Slovakia battled three fronts on Sunday. They are setting up firebreaks to prevent flames from spreading to a dense forest or threatening more residential areas. Mum-of-three Helen Tonks, of Manchester, flew into Rhodes on Saturday night with her three daughters and husband ahead of a two-week sunshine break. She told The Sun: “There was absolutely no communication whatsoever. We got out here and were told our hotel was among those evacuated. ""They put us on a coach and brought us to a school in Rhodes old town. There are hundreds of us here. We’ve been put up in makeshift dorms in classrooms. ""Dozens are sleeping on mattresses on the basketball court in the gymnasium.” British holidaygoer James Beale was on his way to his hotel with his partner yesterday when their minibus was stopped and held for almost six hours. ""The whole skyline became covered in smoke, fire engines and police blasted past and suddenly we couldn't see anything,"" he told The Sun. ""The driver didn't speak English and we had no idea what was happening."" They never made it to their hotel and instead have been sleeping on a sheet on the floor of a hotel as they wait for a flight out of the chaos. ""We're not in a bad place like other people, but no one knows anything and Tui is just telling us to sit and wait,"" he added. Jet2 has now cancelled all flights and holidays that were due to depart to Rhodes today, while promising scheduled flights will still fly out of the island. Tui have also now cancelled all their flights and holidays to Rhodes up to and including Tuesday July 25. The British ambassador to Greece said the Foreign Office had sent a ""rapid deployment team"" to help UK tourists who were among the thousands forced to flee. It comes as Greece continues to face high temperatures - with forecasts of up to 45C going into next week . The country also experienced an ""insidious and dangerous"" heat blast earlier this month as temperatures soaring to 40C. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sardinia, Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/b6709fe5-6e93-478f-b1a3-bd8cb8222361.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/41a2c39a-5850-463a-9434-12f06693dd89.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/592aee5a-75d9-4171-9b8c-0b11c06a9cab.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/albert-lying-face-oliver-back-833645486.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-argiris-mantikos-eurokinissi-via-833510240.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1211.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-thousands-tourists-evacuated-hotels-833520106-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VP-MAP-RHODES-v2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/desperate-escape-terrifying-moment-rhodes-833625776.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/desperate-escape-terrifying-moment-rhodes-833625770-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-mum-three-helen-tonks-833584817-1.jpg",My family with four kids was left running for our lives from the Rhodes fires – we waded neck-deep in water to escape,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23146191/family-four-kids-running-for-lives-rhodes-fires-escape/
"A BRIT who was catfished in the middle of the Australian desert was stunned when he found out who his dating app match turned out to be. Resort worker Olly Lewis revealed how dating Down Under took a bizarre turn when a match he had been chatting to for weeks turned out to be a much older colleague from back home. The catfish had stolen the identity of someone in the town where Olly was staying - and sent him on a bizarre wild goose chase. The 26-year-old, from Herefordshire, travelled to Australia on a working holiday visa 18 months ago - where he was duped by a potential hook-up. He told The Sun: ""I thought catfishing was just something that happened on scripted reality TV shows. But no. It happened to me."" Olly had gone to work at the rural Ayers Rock Resort - where the nearest town of Alice Springs was ""roughly a six-hour drive away"". In the ultra-small community, he decided to download a dating app to explore his romantic options. ""There are about thirty of us young people working here,"" Olly said. ""So there's not a lot of us, but when you meet other travellers you form closer bonds."" Olly's app told him there were only four other guys in his area - and then he received a message from someone with a blank profile. Before long, the man had sent him a photo of himself - and Olly recognised him ""straight away"" as someone he'd seen in the gym. Olly began to refer to him as the ""Handsome Discreet Gym Boy"". And after agreeing to meet up after messaging, Olly went out to the Residents Club for some drinks with friends - and heard nothing from his match. After a week, the pair were messaging each other ""semi-regularly"". But once his match started opening up more, things became a ""little unhinged"". The potential date told Olly he didn't want him messaging other people and started mentioning marriage - even asking to size him up for a wedding ring. Olly admitted he ""didn't have much entertainment"" in the desert, so despite the ""bizarre"" messages, he decided to stick it out. Shortly after, Olly found himself out with pals again at the Residents Club, where he saw ""Handsome Discreet Gym Boy"". But the bloke didn't even look at him - leaving Olly baffled. The same thing happened again at a party hosted by a mutual friend. Olly realised he was being completely blanked by the man he'd supposedly been messaging for weeks. When his match hosted his own party, Olly was determined to speak to him in person. After hours of drinking and chatting, the Brit decided to approach the man who he thought he'd been speaking to on the dating app. Olly said: ""I'm like, 'hey, do you want to hang out for a bit?' ""And he looks me dead in the eyes, says no, and slams the door in my face."" When Olly then messaged him the next day asking why he didn't want to hang out, he confusingly replied: ""Sorry, I was working late."" Olly decided his dating app contact was clearly ""too shy"" to ever take the leap and speak to him in real life . Days later, while out for lunch in a café with friends, Olly spied him as he walked in and sat down three tables behind them. Olly's phone then bleeped with a message notification - the man was texting him. But it suddenly dawned on him that the bloke's phone was nowhere to be seen as he tucked into his lunch. As he checked the dating app's location services, it seemed the man he was messaging was actually 1km away - not sitting in the very same café. And when a flummoxed Olly then messaged to ask where the guy was eating his lunch, the dating app deceiver said a different place altogether - confirming his suspicions. Olly rushed to text the person he'd been messaging online - who admitted he had lied before sending a photo of himself. The snap, only designed to last a few seconds, shocked Olly. It turned out the person he had been messaging was a colleague at the resort - not the gym buff in the photograph he had been sent originally. ""He was about twenty years older than it said in his profile,"" Olly said. ""And he definitely is not the handsome, charming gym goer that I've been envisaging while having these conversations."" Happy-go-lucky Olly admitted he has decided not to bring it up with his sneaky co-worker in person. He said: ""It was one of the most chaotic things to ever happen to me. ""And I discovered it had happened before, I wasn't the only victim. ""I work with him, but I never confronted him properly. I felt like it would be too awkward."" Olly said he felt safe and couldn't be bothered to make an enemy in his remote surroundings. And he added: ""I felt like I fell for the catfishing so easily because it's such a small community, I never thought someone would impersonate another person."" Despite his dating app fail , Olly recommended the working holiday visa to any Brits looking to apply. He said: ""People always think it's the bravest thing ever to fly out this far, but as long as you've got a way back, what's the worst that could happen? ""Though they do love the word 'Pommie' for us Brits out here."" Olly posts videos about his experiences abroad on his Tiktok, @ollytedlewis , and makes sure not to romanticise some of the misadventures involved in moving across the world. In one video, he warns Brits about the things they might miss out on in Oz, including high street grub: ""I miss easy snacks. In the UK, you've got your Greggs , you've got your meal deals."" Olly's been left with one overwhelming piece of advice: ""Don't be too trusting on dating apps!"" But ultimately, Olly insisted taking the plunge and moving Down Under was totally worth it - before laughing, ""I don't think anyone's dying to come to Australia after my catfishing story.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/54e4e03b-ab73-417e-b3b0-55ffe7a507bb.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d04fcdd4-c0cb-4b59-9999-5f52c09c2483.jpg",I was led on wild goose chase through Australian desert by a catfish on dating app – then I made a horrifying discovery,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23058711/catfished-desert-australia-dating-app/
"GREECE has issued ""extreme fire risks"" for tomorrow in seven new areas across the country as wildfires engulf Rhodes for the sixth day. The Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection has sounded the alarms after temperatures have soared in the holiday hotspot. The ministry has raised the fire risk to ""extreme"" in the areas of Attica, Evia, Boeotia, Corinthia, Ilia, Argolis, Messinia and Rhodes - which is already battling with the worst blaze Greece has ever seen. Greece continues to face high temperatures - with forecasts of up to 45C going into next week as government agencies have warned people to stay indoors. The country has faced fires in the past but the hotter, drier and windy summers have brought more fires in recent years. The country also experienced an ""insidious and dangerous"" heat blast earlier this month with temperatures also soaring to 40C. In Rhodes, up to 19,000 locals and tourists have been forced to flee in the biggest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen as the fires on the popular island rage on into their sixth day. They said that 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels. Over 250 firefighters, helicopters, water-bombers and emergency rescuers are battling the blaze that has been engulfing the south and central parts of the island, burning down homes and hotels. Yiannis Artopios, a fire service spokesman, said: “The focus now is to contain two major fronts in the south and central part of the island. ""The regions hit so far may account for less than 10 per cent of the island’s hotel infrastructure, but if left unchecked the blazes can threaten the remaining 90 per cent.” British Embassy officials in Athens urged Brits to leave the area on Saturday evening - as flights into Rhodes continue to be cancelled. Extraordinary scenes show columns of tourists and locals travelling on foot and carrying their belongings and children down dusty roads. Busloads of fleeing Brits were taken to makeshift camps in gyms, schools and hotel conference centres where they staged overnight on mattresses on the floor. Coastguard vessels and more than 20 private boats took part in an operation to evacuate swathes of tourists and local residents late into the night on Saturday. Horror footage emerged of scores of people with young children desperately waiting to be loaded onto boats in total darkness as fires burned in the background. It comes as British dad-of-four has described his family's hell as they fled the Rhodes inferno in the dead of night. PE Teacher Daniel Jones told The Sun he had to wade into the ocean neck deep to get his young family onto a pleasure boat to escape the flames that chased them. ""It has been a nightmare, our holiday has been ruined, our kids traumatised,"" he said. ""There was still a lot of confusion, it was madness. There were no reps or anyone to tell us what was happening. ""There was a moment where you could clearly see the flames moving closer but there were no boats to escape, I felt completely powerless to protect my family."" Are you in Rhodes right now?

Greece's Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection has released guidlines for those that live in the countryside: They warn that no one should burn rubbish or dry grass and branches in the peak summer months. Nor should anyone be lighting outdoor barbecues in the woods or near dry grass right now. They advise not to throw away any lit cigarettes or leave any litter in the forest due to the risk of ignition. If you're house is near a forest - they recommend creating a fire zone around the house by clearing dry grass, pine needles and branches in a radius for at least 32ft. Call the Fire Service IMMEDIATELY (tel. 199) and give clear information about: - the location and the exact point where you are, - the location, the exact point and the direction of the fire. - the type of vegetation being burned. If the fire approaches your home: stay calm, move flammable materials, turn of natural gas and fuel supplies around home and put a ladder outside the house so that access to the roof is available.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-argiris-mantikos-eurokinissi-via-833509658-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-shows-smoke-rising-burnt-833620055-3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/extreme-fire-risk-attica-rhodes-833662017.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-thousands-tourists-evacuated-hotels-833520106-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VP-MAP-RHODES-v2.jpg",Urgent holiday warning for popular Brit destination as seven new ‘extreme fire risk’ alerts issued amid Rhodes chaos,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23147058/urgent-holiday-warning-greece-extreme-fire-risk-alerts-rhodes/
"A HANDYMAN who grew bored of living in the city moved out into the countryside and dug himself a CAVE. The DIY expert - who calls himself Mr Tiger - has charted the construction of his dream subterranean home on his channels on YouTube and Ixigua. Tiger returned to his hometown in rural China after growing tired of his life in the big city and decided to create his own dream home. He used machine tools to carve out the hole - cutting the stone until he created a large enough space to live. The handyman then went out about furnishing the property with all the mod cons, including plumbing and electricity. And the result was a cosy cave home that he is constantly updating, digging out extra rooms and even setting himself up a small farm. His social media channels reveal he had been working hard in the city for 10 years. But he grew tired as he still couldn't afford to buy his own home, so instead he decided to build his cave. Tiger posted a video explaining he didn't want to feel like a ""slave"" anymore and wanted his full independence - with no debt. ""Life is not easy, the most important thing is to persevere, work hard, and hope to see the result,"" Tiger wrote on his Ixigua page. His cave home is located in the province of Sichuan, China - which is home to some 81million people, which is bigger than the population of the UK. Tiger decided to furnish his property once again with the tools of his own labour. He built his own furniture out of lumber, installed solar panels, set up a garden, a pond, and even built a fence for his front yard. His cave home was featured by channel Quantum Tech HD - with the video being viewed some 168million times since June 2021. And after building his cave house, Mr Tiger keeps his fans regularly up to date with new videos about the developments. Internet users were very impressed by his accomplishment. One wrote: ""Anyone who’s ever done construction work can relate how incredibly difficult this is, mentally and physically. ""To have the willpower to see this through is beyond my comprehension. Respect."" Another added: ""The amount of knowledge and patience this man has is incredible."" And one compared his efforts to the construction of ancient structures such as the Pyramids of Egypt.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fsdgfdsgfdsgfdsgfdshgfdhgf.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/81501c67-88da-4df6-a26a-27a740ed8c37.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-youtube-com-watch-v-833670971.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-youtube-com-watch-v-833670980.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-youtube-com-watch-v-833671616.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gafgfgfdsgffdsg.png",I worked in the city for 10 years but still couldn’t afford a house – so I dug myself a CAVE and created my dream home,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23147421/tiny-home-cave-dream-dug/
"A MUM has told of the heartbreaking moment her daughter, 5, asked if they were going to die as they fled the wildfires in Rhodes. Joanna Hughes, 35, her husband Jon, 38, and their daughter Emilia travelled to the Greek island for a family holiday before the disaster struck . The couple paid £3,600 for the 10-night all-inclusive break at the Lindos Imperial Resort & Spa in Kiotari, which they booked through Jet2. But instead of the dream trip - they were left fleeing for their lives as 19,000 tourists and locals were evacuated as fires burned across Rhodes. Joanna and her family were forced to leave their belongings at their hotel - which they later were told had burned down in the inferno. ""We were trying to keep ourselves together but Emilia could see that it wasn't right. She could sense it,"" she said. ""She did say a couple of times 'Are we going to die?'. That is something I won't forget for a long time."" ""I've not stopped crying since we got home."" They joined thousands of other tourists as they walked along the rocky beach during extreme heat in search of safety. The family, from Murton, County Durham, walked for four miles to escape the flames and thick black smoke. But they finally reached a hotel where the Army and police were transporting people away from the area. Officers took them in a police car to a third hotel 13 miles away, where they met another family from Germany, who had a rental car. The two families made the decision to team up and drive across the other side of the island so they could reach the airport and return home. Joanna, who works in HR, said she has been told that the hotel they were staying in, and surrounding hotels, have been burned down. She said: ""Thousands of tourists had to flee. We were heading towards the water to try and keep as far away from the mainland as we could. ""We just had to walk along the beach, it was really rocky."" ""Then one guy shouted 'come up this way' and we had to turn and walk up a bank. ""That's when an ash cloud came down. It was just like walking in an oven, it was so hot. I couldn't see at all."" ""There were babies wrapped in towels, it was horrific. We were up so high and we had no where to go, we had to keep going or we would be engulfed with the smoke. ""You could see the flames in the mountains. ""We were just walking and walking away from the flames that were coming down. We just didn't have a clue where we were going. We were following one road and there was no plan."" Joanna, Jon, an engineer for National Grid, and Emilia travelled to the hotel in Rhodes on Wednesday (July 19) and were due to return home on Saturday, July 29. Joanne said: ""It was our summer holiday with Emilia. She's in reception so it's our first in the school holidays. We wouldn't usually have gone at peak time. ""When we landed we were in the taxi to get to the resort and we could see the smoke already. The taxi driver said the fire had been going for a few days. ""She seemed alright about it and when we got to the hotel the receptionist said 'It's fine, it's in the mountains, it won't get near us'. They didn't seem very worried about it."" Joanna said that on Saturday afternoon the wildfires got worse and they decided to leave the hotel. She said: ""We were around the pool until about 12.30pm. The black cloud was coming over from the mountains and it got gradually worse and worse. ""We had our pyjamas on as we couldn't sunbathe as it was so cloudy and the ash was coming down on us. ""We picked up at that point that we had to make the decision to go. We grabbed one bag, our passports and some cash and we left. ""Some of the hotel staff were shouting to leave but there wasn't an evacuation process and no one was accounted for. ""I don't know, if at that point there was any fire at the hotel, but there were no alarms going off. ""It was very much a matter of talking to your neighbour next to your room and making a decision."" Joanna said that they walked four miles in the heat and took it in turns to carry Emilia, who had a blister on her foot and had been stung by a wasp. After reaching the airport, Joanna said they paid £300 each to secure a TUI flight back to Newcastle on Sunday morning. Joanne has slammed Jet2 for not getting in touch with them, and other holidaymakers, during the whole time they were there. She said that she only received a message from them on Sunday morning, when they were already back in Newcastle. She said: ""We pretty much always go with Jet2 holidays. I have got friends who work for the airline and we usually can't fault them. ""It does make you worry that no one is accounted for. There was no rep there, there was nothing. ""We didn't have any contact from them at all, not even a text to say 'we're aware of the ongoing situation'. I got a message from them this morning but that's no use to us, we're already home."" Jet2 has since cancelled all flights to Rhodes until next Sunday. A spokesperson said: ""The situation in Rhodes continues to evolve quickly, and our absolute priority is the health, safety and well-being of customers and colleagues in the affected areas.""

"BRITISH families are facing a ""living nightmare"" in Rhodes after fleeing from burning hotels and awaiting rescue on the floors of shelters. The first repatriation flights arrived on the fire-ravaged Greek island this morning to rescue thousands of stranded Britons as the wildfires continue to spin out of control. In Rhodes, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said up to 10,000 British tourists are currently on the island, many of whom ran for their lives. Now, locals and tourists are also being evacuated from large swathes of Corfu as more blazes rip through the country on Sunday. People in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia and Sinies on the island have been told to leave immediately. Both easyJet and Jet2 are planning repatriation flights to Rhodes today to bring Britons home. EasyJet will operate two rescue flights to Rhodes totalling 421 seats on Monday and a third on Tuesday, in addition to its nine scheduled flights to the island. One such evacuation flight touched down in Manchester this morning and exhausting-looking families hugged relieved relatives tightly. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed a Rapid Deployment Team had arrived on Rhodes to support travel operators in bringing Britons home. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns said: “Travel companies must not fail British nationals — they have a duty to help get people back. “If they fail, the British government will have to take action, but commercial flights are still fully viable,"" she told The Daily Telegraph. Over the weekend, extraordinary scenes have shown columns of people carrying their luggage and children on dirt roads as they tried to find safety. Most fleeing Brits have spent the night in makeshift camps across the island - with young kids forced to sleep on mattresses in classrooms, gyms and stadiums. Others found refuge on the beach over the weekend as they waited often in darkness to be transported to safety by boats. Andrew Mitchell, the foreign office minister, said yesterday that there were “only ten free beds on the whole island”. Over 250 firefighters - backed by aircraft water-bombers and reinforcements from Slovakia - battled three blaze fronts in Rhodes on Sunday, sparking the biggest fire evacuation ever seen in Greece. The flames have burned for nearly a week on the island after the country was hit by high temperatures and strong winds that make it challenging to contain the blaze. Mum-of-six Helen Tonks, from Cheshire, said she was flown into a ""living nightmare"" by Tui at 11pm on Saturday and discovered her hotel had been closed. She said she and her family were ""abandoned"" and forced to sleep with hundreds of others on a school floor. Helen told The Sun: “There was absolutely no communication whatsoever. We got out here and were told our hotel was among those evacuated. ""There are hundreds of us here. We’ve been put up in makeshift dorms in classrooms. ""Dozens are sleeping on mattresses on the basketball court in the gymnasium.” Connie Woods from Northern Ireland has been sleeping in a school for two nights after fleeing the blaze encroaching her hotel. She said there were hundreds staying at the school - ""it's getting quite crowded,"" she told the BBC . ""So many young children, families with no luggage, newborn babies. It's awful."" Some flights out of Rhodes were delayed on Sunday night, and there were further delays amid the overnight flights. Further easyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair flights from Rhodes are scheduled to arrive at Gatwick, Stansted and Bristol this afternoon. Tui- who had 40,000 tourists in Rhodes, 7,800 of which were impacted by the fires - has cancelled all its flights to the island until Wednesday, but they said those already in Rhodes will return on their scheduled flights. A spokeswoman for easyJet said it was doing ""all it can"" to help customers in Rhodes and invited those due to travel to or from the island until Saturday to change the date for free. British Airways says its flights are running as normal, but those returning early could change their flight for free. Are you in Rhodes right now? Tell us your story!

The country also experienced an ""insidious and dangerous"" heat blast earlier this month as temperatures soaring to 40C. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/000-people-evacuated-greek-island-833731417.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/evacuees-rhodes-willd-fires-camping-833744197.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VP-MAP-RHODES-v2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1216.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c0cfe27f-82b2-431e-932c-9db999e71595.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/holidaymaker-shane-murphy-jones-arrives-833722780.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tourists-sleep-wait-departing-planes-833752210.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1213.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/000-people-evacuated-greek-island-833679015.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-picture-obtained-social-media-833713270.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefighting-plane-drops-water-wildfire-833674470.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/joanna-hughes-husband-jon-hughes-833682734.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/41a2c39a-5850-463a-9434-12f06693dd89.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-locals-tourists-fled-hotspots-833685380.jpg",Brit families facing ‘living nightmare’ in Rhodes fires as they sleep on floors in shelters while waiting for rescue,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23148082/brits-war-zone-evacuated-rhodes-wildfires-tourists-travel-chaos/
"A FORMER paratrooper who was mauled by a 50-stone shark has relived the ""terrifying"" moment his arm and leg were ripped off. Paul de Gelder, 46, from Melbourne, Australia , was swimming in Sydney Harbour when he nearly died in a shark attack . The former Navy clearance diver was doing a routine military exercise with the Australian Navy in February 2009. Paul recounted how the bull shark 's razor-sharp teeth shredded through his flesh in ""one bite"" ahead of Shark Week. He told CNN : ""I was swimming from point A to point B on the surface on my back and a 10-foot bull shark came up from underneath me. ""It grabbed me by the back of my right leg and my right hand, which was by my side, all in one bite."" Paul recalled how he swam back to the rescue boat in a pool of his own blood while feeling his whole hamstring, most of his right leg, and all the nerves torn off by the shark . He added: ""It took me under. ""The pain and the terror. I thought I was going to die. It removed my hamstring and my hand. ""I had to swim back to my safety boat with one hand and leg through a pool of my own blood. I didn't think I was going to make it. ""I'm very, very lucky and blessed to still be here and breathing today."" The Army vet and former paratrooper previously described how he attempted a counterattack on the ""terrifyingly aggressive"" apex predator with his left hand. He said: ""That's when it started to shake me like a rag doll. ""As its teeth worked through my flesh and bone like saws, I was overcome by the most intense pain imaginable."" Paul spent three months in rehabilitation, but miraculously returned to work for the Navy. He wanted to return to his old job role as a diver but was instead given the opportunity to public-speak in 2012. The double amputee is now a motivational speaker and has become an advocate for sharks. ""I see my role as speaking up for an animal that doesn't have a voice,"" Paul said. ""I figure if someone like me who has almost lost their life and two limbs to a shark can understand why they are so important and why they need to be saved, then maybe everyone else should be able to as well.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/350-teeth-shook-like-rag-751871521.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2012-sydney-australia-paul-de-751870791.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bull-shark-swims-gloomy-dark-818813522.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2013-sydney-australia-motivational-speaker-751870783.jpg",I was mauled by 50-stone shark – I felt 350 teeth working through my bones like a saw as it ripped off my arm & leg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23149079/mauled-shark-teeth-bones-ripped-off-arm-leg/
"RAGING wildfires are still ""out of control"" on the island of Rhodes as new evacuation orders come into force. At least 19,000 locals and tourists have already been rescued from the fire-ravaged island in the biggest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen - with up to 10,000 Brits still stranded. Terrified holidaymakers have been forced to flee burning hotels , wade through water and sleep on gym floors - with repatriation flights finally arriving on Monday to rush Brits out of the country. Wildfires erupted on the island of Corfu - and Level 5 alerts were issued for Crete amid fears of a similar inferno. The deputy mayor of Rhodes, Konstantinos Taraslias, said the fires are still burning out of control after seven days of fighting them. Taraslias said thousands of people need to be evacuated and given shelter as the flames rip through tourist hotspots. Two more villages on the island - Malona and Massari - were facing fresh evacuation orders from the government on Monday. More than 16,000 people have been evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels - many of them Brits. Extraordinary scenes showed columns of people carrying their luggage and children on dirt roads as they desperately tried to find safety. Many found temporary refuge on the beach as they waited in darkness overnight to be transported to safety by boats. Other fleeing Brits spent the night in makeshift camps across the island - with young kids forced to sleep on mattresses in classrooms and gyms. Fires also erupted on the popular island of Corfu on Sunday night - with shocking photos showing the north of the island engulfed in flames. Nearly 2,500 locals and tourists were evacuated overnight, the fire department said. Around 59 people were scrambled onto boats at Nissaki beach as the frantic evacuation effort began, according to the Greek Coast Guard. People in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia and Sinies on the island were urged to leave. An SOS message said: ""If you are in Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia Perithia & Sinies, evacuate now to Kasiopi. ""Wildfire in your area - follow instructions of authorities."" Footage showed the orange glow of the fires in the distance - with clouds of black smoke rising into the sky . Speaking on Monday morning, Theofanis Skembris, deputy mayor of North Corfu, believes the fires on the island were started deliberately. He told the BBC : ""There were four fires that started simultaneously. ""We have to wait for the investigation, but their first unofficial assumption is that it was arson - fires can't start simultaneously in four different places. ""The situation in the island is better now. Most of the fires are under control. There are firefighting planes helping."" British Embassy officials in Athens urged Brits to leave Rhodes on Saturday evening - as holidays and flights continue to be cancelled. The Foreign Office has also scrambled an evacuation team. The British ambassador to Greece , Mathew Lodge, said the Foreign Office had sent a ""rapid deployment team"" to help UK tourists who were among thousands forced to run for their lives. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said up to 10,000 British tourists are currently on the island of Rhodes. He told Times Radio: ""This is peak holiday season."" PM Rishi Sunak said his ""paramount priority is the safety of British nationals"". He added that Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden chaired a Cobra meeting on the wildfires yesterday. ""He's been monitoring the situation closely"", Sunak said. ""The most important thing is people remain in touch with their tour operators, there are lots of flights going back and forth to be able to bring people home, and if people are in touch with their tour operators they will get the information that they need."" The first repatriation flights arrived on Monday to rescue Brit holidaymakers. EasyJet will run two rescue flights with a total of 421 seats on Monday and a third on Tuesday, in addition to its nine scheduled flights to the Greek island. Are you in Corfu or Rhodes right now? Tell us your story . Contact the foreign desk at imogen.braddick@thesun.co.uk or worldnews@the-sun.co.uk Over 250 firefighters, backed by aircraft water-bombers and reinforcements from Slovakia , battled three fronts in Rhodes on Sunday. The flames have burned for nearly a week on the island after the country was hit by an extended spell of extreme heat that has made it challenging to contain the blaze. The EU has sent 450 firefighters and seven planes to the country to help battle dozens of fires. A British dad-of-four described his family's hell as they fled the Rhodes inferno in the dead of night. PE Teacher Daniel Jones said he had to wade into the ocean neck deep to get his young family onto a pleasure boat to escape the flames that chased them. ""It has been a nightmare, our holiday has been ruined, our kids traumatised,"" he told The Sun. ""There was still a lot of confusion, it was madness. There were no reps or anyone to tell us what was happening. ""There was a moment where you could clearly see the flames moving closer but there were no boats to escape, I felt completely powerless to protect my family."" British holiday-goer James Beale was on his way to his hotel with his partner yesterday when their minibus was stopped and held for almost six hours. He told The Sun: ""The whole skyline became covered in smoke, fire engines and police blasted past and suddenly we couldn't see anything. ""The driver didn't speak English and we had no idea what was happening."" They never made it to their hotel and instead have been sleeping on a sheet on the floor of a hotel as they wait for a flight out of the chaos. Tourist Ian Wakefield told Times Radio he spent the night in a school playground in Faliraki after being moved from his hotel in Pefki. He said: ""It didn't really feel real - being in imminent danger of being burned to death. ""Between midnight and around 5am this morning we were going through an evacuation which was pretty chaotic. ""There were a lot of upset people and children who were understandably quite hysterical. ""It was all very confusing - the instructions from the hotel manager were unclear. You had to make your own choice in the end.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1cfe6c2d-e775-47dd-935a-a5829480f90f.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833869724.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/resident-tries-extinguish-flames-yard-833865659.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/man-walks-next-burnt-sunbeds-833865810.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CORFU-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VP-MAP-RHODES-v2-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-maxar-technologies-handout-via-833697846.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833869550.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/corfu-fire-july-23rd-https-833808643.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-fire-broke-northern-part-833736675.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-still-image-obtained-social-833760094.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1222.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1224.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1223.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/evacuees-rhodes-willd-fires-camping-833745508.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/holidaymaker-shane-murphy-jones-arrives-833722780.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/satellite-image-shows-area-affected-833754782.jpg","Rhodes wildfires ‘out of control’ with new evacuations ordered & 10,000 Brits trapped as flames ravage Corfu",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23149569/raging-wildfire-spreads-second-greek-island-corfu/
"THE eerie wreck of an abandoned cruise ship has been left to rot on a  tourist beach in a tropical paradise. MS World Discoverer is a half-sunken ocean liner which sits, tipped to one side, in Roderick Bay in the Solomon Islands . The vessel was originally built by Schichau Unterweser in Germany in 1974 and was able to navigate the Northwest Passage . It was first sold to the Danish company BEWA Cruises and then two years later to Adventure Cruises Inc. In 1990 the ship was registered in Liberia and six years later underwent a complete refurbishment. The globetrotting cruise ship featured an observation lounge, a library, a sun deck with a swimming pool and a small fitness centre. Measuring 287ft (87m) in length, it was able to carry nearly 140 passengers. But a fateful date on April 30, 2000, with an uncharted reef ended its seafaring career for good . The ship began to list and captain Oliver Kruess had no choice but to ground her in the beautiful Sandfly passage of the Nggela Islands. British passenger David Wright described the moment the ship was brought into Roderick Bay. ""It was just rammed into the beach, breaking trees in the forest, which stretches down to the shore,"" he told The Herald . ""It was quite spectacular. And when we reached the beach, we could see a tree hanging from the prow of the ship."" Everyone on board was safely evacuated, but the ship has since been been left to rust and slowly crumble into the ocean. Several salvage companies have made attempts to retrieve the ship, but to no avail. The ship has become a popular tourist attraction for both locals and those who visit the Solomon Islands.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2000-striking-uncharted-reef-rusty-833730783.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mother-nature-slowly-reclaiming-world-833730679.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TM-Map-Soloman-Islands-v2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2017-roderick-bay-solomon-island-833730680.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2000-striking-uncharted-reef-rusty-833730789.jpg",Inside story of eerie wreck of an abandoned cruise ship left to rot on tourist beach in tropical paradise,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23150044/wreck-abandoned-cruise-ship-tourist-beach-tropical-paradise/
"UKRAINIAN leader Volodymyr Zelensky has trademarked his last name to stop anyone cashing in on his international fame. The president, who has led his country’s defence against the Russian invasion , had lawyers apply for it last October. It came eight months after the war began and he shot to world prominence. Details of the paperwork securing his global rights were published this month. And among an array of items covered by the trademark under the Ukrainian spelling “Zelenskyy” are underwear, hats, video games , kitchen utensils and knives. Other unusual products included are toilet brushes and loo roll holders. Mr Zelensky , 45, has been praised for his country’s efforts in holding off the Russian war machine against huge odds. But those hoping to cash in on his reputation as a ­military mastermind will be sorely disappointed. He has also trademarked his name for military equipment, including guns, ballistic weapons, explosives, grenades and rocket launchers. There is often talk of Russian President Vladimir Putin sending his men into the meat grinder — and now there is a “Zelenskyy” branded meat grinder for kitchens. He has also trademarked his name for use on national tipple vodka and all other alcoholic drinks . Ukraine has used drones to deadly effect and the president has the right to set up his own firm under the name Zelenskyy Drones. The trademarking also prevents others from starting a comedy club using the former TV funnyman’s name.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NEW_AFP_33NT4P7jpg-JS831206457.jpg,Ukraine’s hero President Zelensky trademarks his name in bid to stop anyone cashing in on his reputation,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23150500/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-trademarks-name-stop-merchandise/
"MCDONALD'S once launched McPlanes, McTrains and McBoats in an attempt to expand its much-loved range. The fast-food chain served Big Macs on jets and trains, and even opened two floating restaurants for Maccies lovers to get their fix. In 1980 the chain made waves with its first water restaurant. It opened the floating food joint in an old-fashioned paddle steamer on the banks Mississippi River . The McBoat was a hit and could sit  134 customers inside and 200 more on open-air decks. At the time, McDonald's real estate manager told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch : ""We have nothing like this in the whole world."" The floating restaurant stayed open for two decades before it was closed in 2000. Another boat, which was dubbed McBarge, opened for six months in 1986. MailOnline said the Canadian restaurant was said to have been able to play host to 1,400 diners over two decks. In the years that followed the chain launched a McTrain. It teamed up with Germany 's rail service and offered moving restaurant carriages in 1993. The foodie carriage sported the well-known golden arches, could seat 27 people inside and offered Maccies' favourites. It also offered two four-course meals to passengers in first class, but that ended up being extended to all. But, it was quickly wrapped up within just two years as it was said to have failed to bring in customers as it was initially thought it would. The following year McDonald's partnered up with a Swiss private air charter company Crossair and your company Hotelplan to take to the skies. The aircraft was kitted out with red seats and the golden arches, while the outside was bright red. A trolley service was offered up the aisles and air hosts and hostesses would hand out Big Macs in a box. On top of the Maccies meal, jet setters were given souvenirs, a certificate and toys for youngsters. Ralf Pieprzyk, who worked for Crossair when the McPlane launched, revealed that the meals were not from a traditional McDonald's supplier and they had to be custom-made so they could be ""stored and served later in cruise flight"". He added: ""[It was a] great idea, our customers and planespotters loved it.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cb944896-b361-40d5-a3fd-2b1a6977938c.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mcbarge-mcdonalds-floating-restaurant-833667275.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mcdonalds-train-833703596.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mcdonalds-inflight-meal-833666686.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mcdonalds-train-interior-833712153.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/px79pr-mcbarge-rests-burrard-inlet-833664056.jpg","Inside McDonald’s weird plans to expand into TRAVEL as they launched McPlanes, McTrains and McBoats",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23150222/inside-mcdonalds-weird-travel-plans/

"AT LEAST 11 students have been reported dead after a school gym roof collapsed in China. The incident took place at No 34 Middle School in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang province, where the girls volleyball team had been training. There were 19 people in the stadium at the time of the collapse, according to local media, which reported four people had managed to escape. Officials said rescue efforts were complete but did not reveal details of the victims. Several Chinese media outlets reported that most were students. After the collapse on Sunday, a video showed the roof of the reinforced-concrete gymnasium completely destroyed. A witness told local media that there was “nowhere to hide” from the overhead collapse inside the gym. China Youth Daily reported that the girls were training over the summer holidays because they were expected to go to Hubei province for upcoming games. The official WeChat account of Qiqihar No 34 Middle School posted an article just a day before the incident celebrating the girls’ volleyball team taking second place in the Heilongjiang provincial student games. According to local media, a construction company overseeing a new building next door to the school had stored perlite building materials on the roof of the gym before it collapsed after heavy rain. South China Morning Post reported that an engineering expert who teaches at China Agricultural University said on his personal social media page that perlite could weigh ten, or even 25, times its original weight when soaked with rainwater, “greatly increasing roof loads and potentially leading to the collapse”. A family member told local reporters that his niece was a member of the school’s female volleyball team and was training at the gym at the time of the incident. In a video that went viral on social media, a furious father said that the government sent cops to keep a watch on parents but did not send anyone to update them about their kids. “They tell me my daughter is gone but we never got to see the child. All the children had their faces covered with mud and blood when they were sent to the hospital. I pleaded, please let me identify the child. What if that wasn’t my child?” the man said. The incident is still reportedly being investigated.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-shows-rescuers-working-site-833830371.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-shows-rescuers-working-site-833830443.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-eleven-people-killed-roof-833830448.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-shows-site-collapsed-middle-833830367.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-according-rescue-services-24-833836773.jpg",At least 11 killed as school gym roof collapses on top of girls’ volleyball team in China,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23151725/11-killed-school-gym-roof-collapses-china/
"AN URGENT warning has been issued for British holidaymakers in Spain as temperatures are forecast to reach 39C today. The Spanish Ministry of Health urged tourists to steer clear of beaches in popular resorts on the Med coast. Experts advised holidaymakers to stay as long as possible in cool, shaded places as temperatures peak in the heatwave . Spain's Met Office issued an orange alert today on the coast around Alicante, where it is set to hit 39C. Temperatures are also expected to reach 38C in Majorca and 36C in Barcelona . Tourists were advised to frequently drink water - even if the don't feel thirsty. Health officials have also warned visitors to avoid drinks with caffeine, alcohol or lots of sugar as they can make you severely dehydrated in hot weather. They also urged people to reduce physical activity in the central hours of the day. Officials recommend wearing light, baggy clothes that allow you to sweat as well as eating light meals that will help replace the salt lost through perspiration. Holidaymakers are also being told to store any medication they have in a cool place as the severe heat can alter its effects. Anyone suffering symptoms related to hot weather for more than an hour is urged to seek medical help. It comes after Majorca faced a red alert weather warning last week with temperatures reaching up to 43C . Earlier wildfires erupted in the Spanish island of La Palma on July 15, leading to the evacuation of more than 4,000 people. Forecasters from the United Nations ' weather agency the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) have warned Europe's hot weather is expected to persist into early August. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. But the UK Met Office said Brits would not experience similar heat this summer, saying there was ""no forecast signal"" for temperatures to match the heatwave the UK felt last year .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/people-enjoy-summer-holidays-sandy-830594343.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/take-cover-urgent-spain-holiday-833859434.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sarenal-mallorca-balearic-islands-spain-833456940-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-spain-issued-hot-weather-832581375.jpg",Urgent Spain holiday warning over 39C ‘heat alerts’ as Brits told to steer clear of beaches,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23153305/urgent-spain-holiday-warning-heat-alerts-beaches/
"A SKIER'S embarrassing checklist of life goals that included ""get jacked"" and ""have three girls on roster"" has left fellow snow-lovers in stitches.

A snap of the device's lock screen revealed the ""top eight"" objectives the snow sport enthusiast had set out to achieve. The list began with short-term targets: ""Get jacked and be 87kgs. ""Quit all nicotine."" It continued with a few modest goals: ""Have $25,000 in bank account. ""Get good marks at uni. ""Have motorbike."" It then took a barmy turn, with the goals escalating to more fanciful ambitions: ""Have three girls on roster. ""Get better at fighting. ""Don't get a haircut for three months."" According to local reports, the phone was found ""halfway down"" the Front Valley of Kosciuszko National Park, about 300 miles south of Sydney . It was reportedly handed in at the booking office with hopes the phone's lock screen would identify the owner. With no avail it was posted on Perisher Snow Lovers' Facebook Group, which left social media users baffled. ""I'd be almost embarrassed to claim the lost phone,"" a Facebook user said. ""Zip phone in pocket so I don't lose it or otherwise I won't have a way to check Perisher Snow Lovers to see if someone finds it, unveiling my life goals to the world,"" one added. ""$25K and having three girls on roster lol, tell him he's dreaming,"" a second remarked. ""They are phenomenal goals, nothing to be embarrassed about here,"" another claimed. It comes as Australia's east coast enjoyed a recent spurt of cold weather and dumping of snow at its top ski resorts. About 1.5 inches of powder has fallen at Perisher Ski Resort in the past week - with hundreds of tourists hitting the slopes. The ski hotspot also announced 187 of its snowguns were firing on Sunday after the temperature dropped to -5C.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/320dd27f-3085-4f03-9f43-51539391d0cf.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/g9rfjx-crowd-snow-sports-loving-833841578.jpg",Skier’s embarrassing checklist of life goals revealed on lost phone including ‘get jacked’ and ‘have 3 girls on roster’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23152369/skiers-embarrassing-checklist-life-goals-revealed-lost-phone/
"A FORMER businessman quit his job and transformed an 800-year-old cave into his dream home after receiving a devastating diagnosis of MS. Angelo Mastropietro braved all the odds to turn the abandoned cave into a spectacular house - dubbed The Rockhouse Retreat. After a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in 2007, Angelo’s health meant he quit his job as a recruitment boss in Australia and returned to the UK. In search of a fresh start, he snapped up the cave in the rolling hills of Worcestershire for just £62,000. The unusual home was the first 21st century cave house retreat in Britain - and was sculpted 800 years ago before it was abandoned in 1960. Angelo spent £100,000 single-handedly remodelling the building - fitting the striking space with underfloor heating, running water and high-speed WiFi. Angelo told Grand Designs Magazine : ""I had this bond with the rock house. ""I was a little bit unsure as to what the next chapter of my life would be, but when I saw it I knew. I was going to be a cave man ."" As he got to work on the project in 2015, he set himself a target of removing 20 wheelbarrows of rubble every day. He would trek up and down the steep bank to the cave 40 times a day - and in total, he removed 70 tonnes of stone. It took two months to carve out the stone and let him get to work on decorating the interior. But after nine months, the transformation was complete - and it was all filmed for Grand Designs . Now dubbed a ""rejuvenating cave stay experience"", couples can stay in the one-of-a-kind home, which is hidden amongst a woodland not far from Kidderminster. Photographs of the home show stunning white rock walls inside the building. The entire house features fur textiles and wooden furniture - giving it a natural feel - and is flooded by natural light from large windows. The property has one stunning bedroom, with a wooden bedframe and simple wood decorations, as well as a hammock for afternoon naps. Angelo said: ""The house has a soul. It’s a magical place, it’s a dream come true really."" Speaking to Grand Designs Magazine in 2017, he said he thought his MS diagnosis would restrict his quality of life. But his transformation of the cave taught him valuable life lessons -  proving he is still fit, healthy and able to cope with challenges. Angelo said he was considering applying for permission to turn it into a permanent home, rather than renting it out for short breaks. The website for the home reads: ""Hidden amongst the tree canopy in three acres of secluded Worcestershire woodland, it is the perfect romantic retreat to rest, relax and rejuvenate your soul whilst listening to the babbling Honey Brook and the hoot of the owls. ""The restoration of this hand sculpted wonder took thousands of man-hours and involved the excavation of over seventy tonnes of rock by hand. ""The Rockhouse Retreat has a generous bedroom with king sized bed and wood burning stove, a cosy sitting room with inglenook fireplace, dining table, fully fitted kitchen with three oven electric range, and under floor heating in the 'cave oasis ' heart shaped show room. ""There is ample terrace for dining where you can either cooking on the gas BBQ or ignite your inner cave spirit with alfresco dining cooked on the firepit under a star-lit night.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cosy-cave-retreat-grass-roofed-822899622.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/700-years-ago-triassic-sandstone-686400176.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/700-years-ago-triassic-sandstone-686400147.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/250-million-year-old-cave-208237317.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cosy-cave-retreat-grass-roofed-822899629.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/250-million-year-old-cave-208237247.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/250-million-year-old-cave-208237246.jpg",I quit my job and built a luxury cave home in nine months after a devastating diagnosis – it changed my life,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23151850/quit-job-built-luxury-cave-home/
"TWO fans of Tollywood star Suriya were electrocuted to death while installing the actor's birthday banner. Nakka Venkatesh and Poluri Sai died immediately after the banner's iron rod came into contact with an overhead electric wire. The incident took place in Palnadu on Sunday, the same day as Suriya's 48th birthday. Cops confirmed that that both victims were second year students of a private degree college in Narasaraopet, India . Their bodies were sent for postmortem at Narasaraopet Government Hospital. Poluri Sai's sister, Ananya, blamed the college for her brother's death, local media reported. She raised concerns about safety measures of doing such activities. She said: ""The college is responsible for my brother's death. ""We are paying lot fees to the college. ""Before joining, they assured us that students would be secured and monitored. ""We are daily labours. We struggle a lot to pay college fees, striving for a good life for my brother. It's an awful incident that happened."" A first glimpse of Suriya's upcoming film Kanguva, said to be a “mighty valiant saga”, was shared on his birthday. Also featuring Disha Patani, the film was directed by Siva and backed by UV Creations and Studio Green. Studio Green tweeted: “The fearless man. The wild life. The powerful story. Get ready to witness it all... The King is here.” The preview was released in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Hindi and English and will be out in four other languages. Suriya has also starred in Telugu films including Thaanaa Serndha Koottam and NGK.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833864501.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833864487.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833864559.jpg",Two fans of Tollywood star Suriya electrocuted to death while hanging actor’s birthday banner,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23154892/fans-tollywood-suriya-electrocuted-to-death-birthday-banner/
"A COUPLE built an incredible DIY tiny home out of an old ambulance and it even has a fold-out hot tub. Chris and Michelle's impressive home on wheels leaves visitors stunned, with some saying it's the best conversion they've ever seen. The metallic grey ambulance was completely transformed by the savvy pair after they were left inspired from several YouTube videos on camper renovations. ""We just decided to give it a go, we loved this ambulance though because it is such a structure, it is totally built out designed for being heavy duty,"" they told Tiny Home Tours. The solid aluminium 2003 e450 ambulance - named Tanya - has many of its original features but the couple decided to remove the overhead cabinets as they were too bulky. A window was also cut into the the side of the wall to give the space extra natural light and they added a fixed bed at one end of the vehicle . ""We wanted a bed we didn't have to put up and down every morning and night,"" they said. The cozy queen-size bed is placed neatly on top of a set of kitchen drawers, next to the stove and oven but has ""plenty of headroom up top"". With its wooden theme and bronze features, the space has completely been renovated from the plain metal box it once was. The couple made their own bespoke kitchen counter top from pine before sanding it down and sealing it with a poly stain sealer for sturdiness. As the DIY pair are keen travellers in snowy destinations, they wanted to ensure the metal home was well insulated for freezing nights. They stuffed the walls with two inches of insulation foam and even covered the ceiling too for added heat retainment. The kitchen drawers slides are from the original ambulance, Michelle revealed, as they tried to use as much of the vehicles authentic features in the build. The ceiling was also made by the pair themselves out of tongue and groove pine they ""just had lying around"". Chris and Michelle even managed to fit in a working shower with hot and cold water that stands in an opposite corner to the bedroom and kitchen area. They also cleverly store their portable toilet in the shower room when it's not in use to save space . But this was just the beginning of the ambulance makeover as the couple decided to carry out a second rebuild where they made a collapsible hot tub and extended the vehicle to a 4x4. ""The whole thing breaks down so we can carry it in the back of Tanya,"" Chris said. The sides of the hot tub are made from plywood with wooden trailer brackets on the corners so it all snaps apart. ""Inside we just have a blue tarp liner that we bought off eBay, and then a m67 immersion heater - so it's military surplus"". The heater is filled with gasoline which slowly drips to a burner plate and then heats up the body of the water. ""And when we're done it all collapses back down so we can pack it up, throw it in the back of Tanya to go to the next spot by a river,"" he said. The couple also made use of the ambulance's ample outside storage space for their battery box and hose closet. Attached to the outside of the vehicle is also a shovel and two recovery mats. The DIY savvy couple bought the ambulance from the fire department for around £4,500 before spending a further £8,000 on the first build renovations. They then extended the home on wheels with the second build which took their total to around £21,000. Michelle revealed that once their dream build was complete, she quit her job and the couple rented out their house so they could take up travelling in their tiny home full time. The couple often document their travels in Tanya on Instagram where followers are left speechless at the jaw-dropping renovation. One commented: ""This is absolutely the best conversion I've seen, everything is extremely well thought-out"". Another said: ""Love this build and the details you not only put into it, but shared with everyone. This is one of my top couple conversions I have seen! Super utilitarian while still being attractive and fun, great build y'all!"" A third wrote: ""This is probably the best conversion I’ve seen. I never thought of an ambulance, but way you guys have it set up is pretty genius!"" This comes after a man converted an old ambulance into his dream tiny home where his dining table becomes his bed. And another bloke converted an old ambulance into a home-on-wheels and now travels the world practically for free.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/siren-song-i-built-amazing-833865836.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/even-fold-out-hot-tub-833877821.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/even-fold-out-hot-tub-833877817.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/even-fold-out-hot-tub-833877819.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/even-fold-out-hot-tub-833877867.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/siren-song-i-built-amazing-833865918.jpg",I built an amazing DIY tiny home out of old AMBULANCE – it even has a fold-out hot tub,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23154560/built-diy-tiny-home-old-ambulance-hot-tub/
"STEAMING rotten corpses of slain Wagner Group thugs have led to the discovery of a mass grave in Siberia. Horrifying footage emerged of the dense forest clearing in Irtkusk, which appeared to show soil dug up for Vladimir Putin's mercenaries. The far-flung Siberian town, about 3250 miles from Moscow , is a hub for Russian aviation but is now reportedly home to more than 60 grave sites. The grim discovery was made by two local journalists who filmed the ad hoc burial site amid the Wagner Group suffering huge casualties in Ukraine . The shocking video showed a mixture of ceremonial graves and open ditches with steam and smoke appearing to billow out as a result of the rotting human remains. Most of the burial sites were marked with a wooden cross, covered in brances and adorned with two wreaths. One garland was in the theme of the Russian tricolour and the other of red-and-yellow flowers of the Wagner emblem. It was reported 53 Wagner graves were identified at the site. However, that only took up a small portion of the cleared land mass - suggesting plenty more dead bodies could be expected. According to Russian news outlet Pravda, 13 tombs of ""war heroes"" were also found at the site. All the fighters buried at Alexandrovskoe cemetery are believed to have died within the period from December 2022 to March 2023. Through local databases, the journalists also found more than 43 of deceased soldiers were convicts aged from 20 to 62. Of them, 17 members were reportedly convicted for murder and the rest on robbery and drug charges. The discovery has shed light on the mounting death toll suffered by Russian forces in Ukraine as the conflict enters its 17th month. In February, US officials claimed more than 30,000 Wagner fighters had been injured or killed since the war began on February 24, 2022. Most of the fatalities were suffered in the meat-grinder in Bakhmut . Nevertheless, seven mass grave sites for the deceased bloodstained thugs have been uncovered across the Russian empire. In January, a macabre cemetery was found in Bakinskaya , Krasnodar. No less than 120 graves were visible there, filled with victims from across Russia, some named, some not. The majority of the slain fighters are believed to be dangerous inmates who were recruited to fight in exchange for their freedom. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin also reportedly touted a cash payment to family members should their relation be killed fighting in Ukraine. Advocacy groups claimed prisoners who enlisted were told their families would receive a payout of 5 million rubles (£43,00) if they were killed. However, an inside source told RadioFreeEurope that most family members have not even been notified of the deaths. The man said: ""Of course, it’s easier for Wagner to bury all those taken out in one place than to deal with the complex logistics and transport for corpses around [Russia] and even to neighbouring countries. ""But this also demonstrates their real attitude toward both the dead and their families."" It comes as the remaining Wagner troops sought refuge in Belarus after their botched coup in June . They shamelessly followed their mutinous maniac boss who was forced to flee after Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko brokered a deal with furious Kremlin officials. The failed uprising was the biggest authoritative challenge Putin has faced since he rose to power in the aftermath of the collapsed Soviet Union. At the time of the coup, Prigozhin vowed to ""punish"" Russia after he blamed the Kremlin for a deadly missile attack on one of his training camps. The former pal of Putin then led an armed rebellion with the stated aim to oust Russia's military leaders as he turned on the top brass in Moscow. Within hours of a 400-vehicle convoy rolling onto Russian soil from Ukraine, Wagner troops seized control of Russia’s regional military HQ in Rostov-on-Don. They rode heavy military machinery, tanks and trucks. Prigozhin bragged his men — believed to be better equipped than the Russian army — did not need to fire a single shot as they took control of the HQ. He said: ""The border guards greeted us and hugged our fighters. If anyone gets in our way, we will destroy everything. We are going all the way."" Kremlin chiefs scrambled pick-up trucks piled full of sand to blockade gateways to Moscow, home to 12million. And then in a bizarre turnaround, Prigozhin told his private army to back down. In an audio message to his troops, he ordered them to return to their bases to ""avoid bloodshed"". Ever since his troops were moved to Belarus, the official whereabouts of the Wagner leader has been questioned. Some experts believe he is either dead or rotting away in a Russian gulag . Putin has since capitalised on his cowering foe and is said to be dismantling the Wagner group .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/grave.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/grave2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-yevgeny-prigozhin-head-wagner-826989125.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/steaminggrave.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/steaming2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-revolt-yevgeny-prigozhins-wagner-828553456-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/000-people-scene-longest-bloodiest-819045950.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-yevgeny-prigozhins-wagner-group-826989360.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-said-retained-ground-control-819105154.jpg",Horrifying Wagner Group mass graves discovered in Siberia wasteland as video shows rotten corpses steaming from ditches,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23154686/wagner-group-mass-graves-siberia-rotten-corpses-steaming/
"BRITISH holidaymakers have been warned of an ""extreme fire risk"" in Crete as large swathes of Rhodes and Corfu go up in flames. Greece's authorities have issued a ""Level 5"" alert for wildfires tomorrow across the holiday hotspot areas of Rethymnon, Heraklion, and Lasithi. Greece's Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection issued the ""extreme risk"" alert for the largest of the Greek islands. Crete could be facing the same fate as Rhodes and Corfu, which have seen extraordinary blazes sweep across the islands - causing thousands to flee. The ministry said that all civil protection services have been placed in ""a state of heightened readiness/alarm provided...due to the increased risk of occurrence and spread of forest fires."" The Greek government at the same time issued a ""very high fire risk (category 4)"" warning for many parts of the nation. This includes the regions of Chania in Crete, central and western Greece, Attica, north and south Aegean, Thessaly, Peloponeese and the Ionian islands. In Rhodes, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels in the largest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen. Terrified holidaymakers have been forced to flee burning hotels , wade through water and sleep on gym floors - with repatriation flights finally arriving on Monday to rush Brits out of the country. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said up to 10,000 British tourists are currently on the island, many of whom are facing a ""living nightmare"". The flames have burned for a week on the island after the country was hit by high temperatures and strong winds that make it challenging to contain the blaze. The island's deputy mayor, Konstantinos Taraslias, said the fires are still out of control after seven days of fighting them. Are you in Rhodes, Corfu or Crete right now? Tell us your story. Contact the foreign desk at iona.cleave@the-sun.co.uk or worldnews@the-sun.co.uk Today, locals and tourists are also being evacuated from large swaths of Corfu as more blazes rip through the country on Sunday. People in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia, and Sinies on the island have been told to leave immediately. It comes as Greece continues to face high temperatures - with forecasts of up to 45C this week as government agencies have warned people to stay indoors. The country also experienced an ""insidious and dangerous"" heat blast earlier this month as temperatures soared to 40C. Greece's Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection has released guidlines for those that live in the countryside: They warn that no one should burn rubbish or dry grass and branches in the peak summer months. Nor should anyone be lighting outdoor barbecues in the woods or near dry grass right now. They advise not to throw away any lit cigarettes or leave any litter in the forest due to the risk of ignition. If you're house is near a forest - they recommend creating a fire zone around the house by clearing dry grass, pine needles and branches in a radius for at least 32ft. Call the Fire Service IMMEDIATELY (tel. 199) and give clear information about: - the location and the exact point where you are, - the location, the exact point and the direction of the fire. - the type of vegetation being burned. If the fire approaches your home: stay calm, move flammable materials, turn of natural gas and fuel supplies around home and put a ladder outside the house so that access to the roof is available. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sardinia, Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-weeklong-wildfire-greek-island-833865294-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ac-crete-fire-warning-map.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000636668468.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-arrested-man-suspected-starting-832395086.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-thousands-tourists-evacuated-hotels-833520106-3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-three-coastguard-boats-leading-833511984-2.jpg",Urgent warning for Brits travelling to Crete over ‘Level 5 wildfire alert’ after Rhodes and Corfu go up in flames,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23159147/urgent-warning-brits-crete-level-5-wildfire-alert-rhodes/
"BENIDORM beachgoers have been spotted trying to beat Brit tourists by setting up their sunbeds in the middle of the night. Snaps show locals scurrying towards the seafront with their deckchairs in hand as they prepare to bag the best spots. In the pitch black, Benidorm locals have been seen making their way down to the sandbanks with their parasols and sunbeds. Images show people setting up large umbrellas by staking the pole through the sand in a bid to claim their territory before the Brit holidaymakers wake up. Rows of colourful parasols and striped deckchairs line the beachfront as the locals ensure they get the best spots to soak up the sun when it rises. Dressed in shorts and sandals, Benidorm locals have been pictured helping each other with their set-ups, all while Brit and German tourists are tucked up in bed. Pitched right in front of the seafront, the competitive locals are taking the front seat in the sunbed wars, forcing other travellers to squeeze in behind them later on in the morning. Flip-flop footprints line the sandy banks with rows  of umbrellas and towels seen stretching the entire length of the beachfront. After their midnight shift of setting up their sunbed gear, locals have also been snapped relaxing in their colourful chairs as they stare out into the black water. Photos taken in the morning show empty deckchairs and umbrellas held to the ground with weighted bags after the locals successfully claim their top spots. But this isn't the first time people have made a mad dash in the battle for the best sunbed. One bloke left TikTok users in hysterics after he was filmed sprinting for the sunbeds at a Spanish resort before dumping five towels down as others scrambled for a space. The rest of the holidaymakers didn't stand a chance as he skipped through the row of seats with his towels at the ready.

A couple of ""sunbed warriors"" were told to ""go back to bed"" after they were caught unstacking the sunbeds at a resort so they could put their towels down before anyone else. And the king of the sunbed hoggers told The Sun Online how to always bag the best loungers by the pool on holiday. The defiant holidaymaker shrugged off controversy over sunbed wars in sunshine resorts, insisting he is only making sure his family has a good time together.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833848272.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833848243.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833847585.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833846412.webp,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833847720-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833846704.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/early-bird-catches-worm-say-833848274.jpg",Incredible moment Benidorm beachgoers try to beat Brits by setting up their sunbeds in the middle of the NIGHT,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23160731/benidorm-beachgoers-brits-setting-up-sunbeds-middle-night/
"A BRITISH mum-of-two has told of her family's traumatising 21-hour escape from the wildfires raging across the Greek island of Rhodes. Tara Rattley, 38, and her family ran for their lives when flames threatened to engulf their hotel - now they are shivering on a hotel floor still in their swim gear. Nurse Tara, her husband and two children, 12 and 13, were lying by the pool on Saturday as they suddenly felt ash falling on them and then the scorching heat of the fast-approaching blaze. The Rattleys had been soaking up the sun at a hotel in Kiotara, one of the first villages to be evacuated after the wildfire swept down from the mountains. ""The sirens went off and we were shouted at to leave now,"" Tara, a nurse from Portsmouth , told The Sun. The family only had time to grab their passports before following orders to head for a faraway beach - a two and half hour hike in 38C. Tara said: ""We had no clue where we were heading, no one was there to direct us, we just knew we had to head in the direction the fire wasn’t. ""At one point the smoke looked like it was surrounding us and although we tried to keep as calm as we could for the children inside we did not know what was going to happen. ""I can honestly say it is the most terrifying thing we have ever experienced and would never want to experience again! ""My friends, my husband and I decided to keep the sea to the left of us so if the fire did come upon us we would get the children and us into the sea."" They joined thousands of other tourists and locals with terror on their faces on a long march to safety, loaded up with children and belongings. Would we go the wrong way and get trapped? Also even if the flames didn’t reach us would the smoke overcome us? As they passed a hotel, they managed to get water and food but safety still eluded them. The wildfire was moving uncontrollably at this point. Fanned by strong winds, it was engulfing large parts of the island's south-eastern parts. ""The fire looked like it was heading in our direction. We went outside and the sky in the distance was orange,"" Tara recalled. Still in swim gear, they were loaded into army trucks at night and headed out in an ill-fated convoy that soon broke down. It was ""pitch black"" when they were stranded and told to go in search of a beach to be evacuated from alone. Holding hands, they used phone torches to guide them. ""We had to keep saying names to make sure we were still all together as it was so hard to see. ""It didn’t take us long thankfully to reach the beach where thousands of people there waiting to get on boats. ""People had passed out, babies crying because they were hungry, adults crying because they were scared.

At Rhodes' port, locals kindly drove the exhausted group to a hotel lobby where they could sleep on the floor. Looking back, Tara said: ""There were definitely moments when we did think 'are we going to make it?' We literally had ash falling on us so knew it was very close."" ""Would we go the wrong way and get trapped? Also even if the flames didn’t reach us would the smoke overcome us?"" They are still on the floor of a hotel lobby in their bikinis recovering from their trauma and waiting for a flight out. ""Even if we hear a plane fly over we think that it is the [fire] helicopters or we smell smoke and our hearts go a little and all it is is someone having a cigarette."" Up to 19,000 locals and tourists, including many Brits, have been forced to flee in the biggest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen as the fires in Rhodes rage on. Up to 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels, while 250 firefighters, helicopters and aircraft water-bombers continue to battle the blaze. Foreign Office Minister, Andrew Mitchell estimates there are up to 10,000 Britons stranded on the popular island and as of yesterday only 10 free beds. A Rapid Deployment Team sent by the Foreign Office has arrived on Rhodes to support travel operators in bringing Brits home. Now, locals and tourists are also being evacuated from large swaths of Corfu as more wildfires rip through the country causing havoc. People in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia and Sinies on the island have been told to leave immediately. Evacuation has also began on the island of Evia (Euboea) as firefighters struggle to contain 82 wildfires across Greece, 64 of which started yesterday. Greek Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced today that the country was ""at war"". “We are at war – completely focused on the fires. Over the coming days and weeks, we must remain on constant alert,"" he told parliament. It comes as Greece continues to face high temperatures - with forecasts of up to 45C going into this week after an "" insidious and dangerous "" heat blast earlier this month. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is not currently forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5a0dda69-a901-4dfc-96c7-1e2b28f2122c.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tara-rattley-833863036.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/f654f04d-ebcd-4b4e-bd01-f6e91a64f5e2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tara-rattley-833863043.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-weeklong-wildfire-greek-island-833865294.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tara-rattley-833863048.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5244c881-1b3a-4265-96b9-2f6c532ddc31.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tara-rattley-833862838.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VP-MAP-RHODES-v2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1237.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-british-evacuee-833823778.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tourists-sleep-wait-departing-planes-833751794.jpg",We went on hellish 21-hour escape in bikinis as Rhodes wildfires chased us into the sea – we feared our kids would die,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23152878/rhodes-wildfires-hellish-escape-family-bikinis-greece/
"FANS have been left devastated after a popular Aussie tourist attraction faces being closed for good after 50 years. The Dolphin Marine Conservation Park in Coffs Harbour, Australia , is on the brink of collapse after facing financial difficulties. The beloved attraction is Australia's oldest captive dolphin conservation park and a family favourite for people across the country. It is one of two Australian sea-life centres that home and treat sick and injured dolphins and is also home to sea lions and turtles. The park revealed it has entered voluntary administration due to a lack of funding, according to 7 News . Located between Sydney and Brisbane , the park had been receiving donations which were its lifeline to surviving after being denied grants by all levels of government, managers said. But following the pandemic and severe weather such as flooding and bushfires, the donations began to dwindle. The parks website has now issued a desperate plea on their website in a bid to save the venue. Managing director Terry Goodall told AAP the animals would be well cared for if they have to move, but it could cost Coffs Harbour up to £10.5million a year in lost tourism revenue. “The animals will be OK — the loser will be Coffs,” he said. “It’s us or the Big Banana.” In a statement, he also said: ""By going public, we hope the government will see that we're at serious risk of closing the marine conservation park and marine wildlife rescue facility and offer support to get us through this tough period. ""We also hope the community will rally around us with support for a fundraising campaign we've launched to continue to provide optimum welfare for the animals in our care and the critical marine wildlife rescue and rehabilitation service for the NSW Coast."" If the park is forced to close, the animals will be re-homed by the industry’s peak body, the Zoo and Aquarium Association Australasia. Closure of the park will also see fifty employees lose their jobs as they continue to ask visitors to donate. The Dolphin Marine Conservation Park has also taken to social media to urge supporters to donate what they can through a PayPal link. ""Consecutive natural disasters, including bushfires , floods, COVID-19 and more floods, have taken their toll on our organisation,"" the page wrote. ""The series of RBA interest rate rises is the last straw. With less discretionary income, fewer people visit, and guests spend less. ""Every donation counts, and we're incredibly grateful for the people and businesses that have already come forward and donated or offered support"". Goodall has also made a last ditch attempt to get families back through the park doors by encouraging those who may have visited the park in previous years to consider returning with family passes now selling for £60. 'If someone's last visit to Dolphin Marine Conservation Park was one to two years ago, they will be impressed with the changes we've made and the incredible connection between our team and animals,' he said. ""A family pass is £60 for two adults and two children for four hours of educational talks, presentations and the opportunity to safely get closer to dolphins and Australian sea lions than anywhere else in Australia. ""With community support, we hope people can continue to experience these unique marine mammals and other marine animals for many more years"".","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/going-popular-aussie-tourist-attraction-833904599.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/going-popular-aussie-tourist-attraction-833904911.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833906134.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833906135-1.jpg",Popular Aussie tourist attraction faces being SHUT DOWN for good after 50 years leaving fans devastated,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23164019/aussie-tourist-attraction-faces-being-shut-down/
"A MAN revealed how he spent £500 on an old horsebox and turned it into a luxury tiny home - all by watching simple YouTube videos. Khylen Baldwin set upon the DIY project during the stifling Covid-19 lockdowns and has since completed the impressive transformation. What was originally a ""complete impulse purchase"" - the mobile home now turns over a tidy profit on Airbnb . In 2020, the Devon man bought the rundown vehicle on Facebook Marketplace for a mere £500. Pictures of the 1980s carriage showed its unremarkable paint job and unkempt insides. From there, the 37-year-old man told Business Insider the worse for wear motor ""just sat around"" in his backyard while he figured out what to do with it. He said: ""I could see in my head that it would look great."" Baldwin's first step was to gut the insides and install floor-to-ceiling windows that allowed for ""much needed light"". The Brit then went to the trouble of installing the plumbing himself and also wiring up solar panels. He also ripped out the front seating and turned the driver's cabin into a double bed. While a teacher at heart, Baldwin said he turned to YouTube to help him construct the mobile home. He also managed to score a trailer, which his pal helped cart to his property via a tractor. Baldwin converted it into an enclosed area that was completed with a  bathroom and composting toilet. The trailer itself is 7ft wide and 21ft long and contains two double beds, a kitchen, a wood-burning stove and an indoor seating area. He said: ""I decorated it just like my house."" Baldwin claimed the whole package could accommodate a family of four and now rents it out on Airbnb for about £70 a night. Having finished the tiny luxury home conversion, Baldwin has his sights on a new project. He said: ""If I found something else the same size, like an army truck, I'd be keen to do it."" Another inventive man has told how he hated paying rent so much he converted his car into a tiny home . One couple revealed how they spent thousands of pounds converting a van into a stunning home on wheels - and now they're travelling the world.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fe796961-1b38-423c-b9f8-cb1bd9f021ba.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/airb2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/khylen.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/air3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ai5.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/air4.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/air6.jpg",I spent just £500 on an old horsebox to turn it into a luxury tiny home…just by watching YouTube,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23162242/old-horsebox-converted-luxury-tiny-watching-youtube/
"EXPERTS have issued a holiday warning over the destinations that could land you with the biggest bills in an emergency abroad. Working with expert Dr Punam, insurance company Staysure has collated a list of the top 10 hot spots using WHO data, which excludes any tests, treatment or medication. Monaco is the most expensive holiday destination to be hospitalised in - with the average night's stay starting from £2,400. Luxembourg is at number two, with prices starting from £1,500 per day - the equivalent of the average cost of fuelling a car for an entire year. Norway comes third with the daily cost for a bed starting from £1,150 - followed by Switzerland, Australia and Denmark. The USA came in at number 10, with the average cost around £600, meaning just four days in hospital could set you back £2,400, excluding any additional costs for treatment. Dr Punam said: ""Not every healthcare system around the world is like the UK's NHS . ""It's only when you see the eye-watering high costs for a hospital overnight stay in other countries, that makes you think whether you'd ever want to take the risk to travel without travel insurance protection. ""Far too often, I see patients who return from holiday having suffered from an unexpected medical emergency abroad who had not bought a prior travel insurance policy. ""Usually those who are otherwise healthy with no other medical history - and later repent how they took their health for granted - are the ones who present to me, experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety due to the financial implications of being hospitalised abroad. ""Whether it's the unforeseen accident, an allergic reaction, a serious chest infection, appendicitis, or even more life threatening such as a heart attack or a stroke , nobody predicts these scenarios happening when they're on holiday. ""It's times like this where the stress levels are so high the last thing you want to be doing is scrambling around for funds to pay for medical help."" Staysure also commissioned research asking 2,000 UK adults who have recently travelled about their past experiences with holiday mishaps and unexpected extra costs. 1. Monaco - £2,400 2. Luxembourg - £1,500 3. Norway - £1,150 4. Switzerland - £900 5. Australia - £700 6. Denmark - £700 7. San Marino - £650 8. Qatar - £600 9. Sweden - £600 10. USA - £600 Almost a fifth (19 per cent) claim to have given visiting a particular holiday destination a second thought because of the possible high-cost medical implications. For those who needed medical treatment while away, it was for situations such as forgetting to pack important medication, suddenly becoming unwell or getting food poisoning. Having an allergic reaction and being stung by a jellyfish or insect were also among the reasons for this. According to the OnePoll.com study, a sixth have previously been caught out financially while abroad which led to them forking out for extra unexpected charges, including paying for emergency medical treatment. But 70 per cent said they always cover themselves with a travel insurance policy before travelling abroad. However, 68 per cent have never had to make a claim on their travel insurance, although 95 per cent would continue to buy a policy to protect their future holidays. When choosing a policy, 75 per cent typically do this online, with 30 per cent of those with a pre-existing medical condition always looking for a provider who can cover their health issues. European beach holidays, long-haul trips, and ocean cruises are the type of holidays they would most likely buy travel insurance for – with 72 per cent shopping around to find the best deal. While 14 per cent state their choice of holiday destination is impacted by their pre-existing medical conditions. Brad May, at Staysure, said: ""Having a tailored travel insurance policy to protect you and your holiday investment is one of the most important elements of any trip abroad. ""As the hospital cost data shows, it can be an expensive and stressful experience if you need a couple of nights stay in a hospital abroad, especially as these daily bed costs do not include medication, tests, or treatment. ""This is just highlighting the top 10 most expensive countries, but wherever you might plan to go on holiday, it could be a false economy to leave home without a tailored travel insurance policy. ""We urge anyone who is travelling to ensure they have a policy in place that covers their medical history, so they’re properly insured for a medical emergency. ""Travel insurance is there to give you peace of mind so you can just relax and enjoy your holiday knowing you’re protected should something go wrong.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/port-monaco-833911271.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/helicopter-landing-pad-hospital-building-833911405.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Staysure_Hospital_Costs_Map_part-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Staysure_Hospital_Costs_Map_part-2.png",Holiday warning over destinations that could land you with the biggest bills in an emergency abroad,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23167345/holiday-warning-destinations-biggest-bills-emergency-abroad/
"SHOCKING before and after pictures reveal the charred remains of a five-star resort in Rhodes after it was destroyed by raging wildfires. Heartbreaking footage shows the aftermath of a catastrophic blaze that continues to rip through the Greek island after seven days. The video starts with holidaymakers relaxing by the pool at the luxury Lindos Imperial Resort and Spa, in the village of Kiotari. But the ""out of control"" fire sparked a mass evacuation, sending at least 19,000 people fleeing . In the second part of the clip, the same pool area of the hotel is covered in ash, while a few burned loungers can be seen in the background. The hotel announced in a social media post that those who still have belongings at the property could go and collect them. It said in a statement: ""The safety and well-being of our guests and staff are our utmost priority and we have taken this precautionary measure to ensure everyone's security. ""We want to emphasise that we are in constant communication with the local authorities, closely monitoring the situation. ""Rest assured, we are taking all necessary measures to address the situation responsibly and ensure a safe environment for everyone. ""During this challenging time, we extend our deepest gratitude for your understanding and support. "" Firefighters on the island are still battling the flames as thousands of people have been forced to evacuate burning hotels , with tourists scrambling to get home on evacuation flights. The deputy mayor of Rhodes, Konstantinos Taraslias, said the fires are still burning out of control after seven days of fighting them. He said thousands of people need to be evacuated and given shelter as the flames continue to rip through tourist hotspots. Fresh evacuation orders were issued for another two villages on the island - Malona and Massari - amid fears the fire will also reach the nearby village of Archangelos. More than 16,000 people have been evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels . Some 30,000 people fled the flames on Rhodes at the weekend, the country's largest-ever wildfire evacuation as extraordinary scenes showed columns of people lugging suitcases along the island's roads. Brits on the island have spoken of facing a ""living nightmare"" fleeing burning hotels. Other British tourists spent the night in makeshift camps across the island - with young kids forced to sleep on mattresses in classrooms and gyms. A dad-of-four from the UK described his family's hell as they fled the Rhodes inferno in the dead of night. PE Teacher Daniel Jones said he had to wade into the ocean neck deep to get his young family onto a pleasure boat to escape the flames that chased them. ""It has been a nightmare, our holiday has been ruined, our kids traumatised,"" he told The Sun. ""There was still a lot of confusion, it was madness. There were no reps or anyone to tell us what was happening. ""There was a moment where you could clearly see the flames moving closer but there were no boats to escape, I felt completely powerless to protect my family."" The Rhodes fire roared down mountain slopes, burning homes and cars and leaving livestock dead on the roadside as they tried to escape. Authorities said no serious injuries were reported, but hospitals and health volunteers provided first aid to tourists and locals. Both easyJet and Jet2 are planning repatriation flights to Rhodes today to bring Britons home. Rhodes on Tuesday remains at the highest level of fire alert, alongside Crete. Greece's authorities have issued a ""Level 5"" alert for wildfires across the holiday hotspot areas of Rethymnon, Heraklion, and Lasithi. Now, locals and tourists are also being evacuated from Corfu after another blaze erupted in Greece. People in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia and Sinies on the island have been told to leave immediately. About 2,400 locals and tourists fled the flames today, a fire service spokesman said. Meanwhile, wildfires also broke out today on Evia, the country's second-largest island. Vassilis Kikilias, Greece's civil protection minister, said crews had battled over 500 fires around the country for 12 straight days. Around 450 firefighters and seven planes have arrived from the EU to help tackle the dozens of fires while neighbouring Turkey sent 10 water-dropping planes and 10 helicopters to join the efforts in Rhodes.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/79abfb1e-e74c-40c6-9ba6-94b55afc0592.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0bd5e16d-6ae0-4f46-a276-ff53bc1fc2cd.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crystal-clear-turquoise-water-glystra-823087446.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833912546.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833897063.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1cfe6c2d-e775-47dd-935a-a5829480f90f.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833896316.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833892149.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833895718.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ac-crete-fire-warning-map.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/APTOPIX_Greece_Wildfires_48473-5d626jpg-JS833920503.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/saturday-22nd-july-greece-wildfires-833663181.jpg",Shocking before and after images reveal charred wasteland of five-star Rhodes resort destroyed by wildfires,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23166363/shocking-before-after-images-charred-wasteland-rhodes-resort-wildfires/
"COPS probing the death of British actor Julian Sands have today brought an end to their six-month investigation. The A Room With A View star 65, went missing in January while hiking in the Baldy Bowl area of California ’s San Gabriel peaks. It was revealed last month that a body had been found in the mountains near where he vanished, and it was later confirmed to be him . Now, weeks on, the probe has come to an end as the actor's cause of death has been deemed ""unexplained"". It was revealed the reason he died is unlikely to be determined due to the condition of Sands' body. The remains had been found five months after the British actor disappeared. CBS News reported a coroner for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said: ""The cause is undetermined due to the condition of the body and the fact that no other factors were discovered during the coroner's investigation, this is common when dealing with cases of this type. ""This is the final determination."" Sands' disappearance sparked a massive search with helicopters and drones combing the area but only his snow-covered Volvo car was recovered near Mount Baldy. He went missing in January on the 10,000-foot Mount San Antonio, known locally as Mount Baldy, just outside the city of Los Angeles . The 65-year-old is an experienced hiker who has previously described himself as happiest ""close to a mountain summit on a glorious cold morning."" Sands' breakout role came in the period drama A Room With A View, in which he starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter . He later moved to the horror genre, featuring in films such as Warlock and Arachnophobia. Most recently he played the chief medical officer in the 2021 Jack Lowden and Peter Capaldi -led drama Benediction. From 1984 to 1987 Sands was married to future Evening Standard and Today editor Sarah Sands, with whom he has a son. He went on to marry Evgenia Citkowitz , who is also a journalist. The couple share two daughters. A timeline of the search for Julian Sands Friday January 13 - Sands is first reported missing to San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Neither the report nor the actor's name are made public immediately, but it states his disappearance was in the Baldy Bowl area. A search-and-rescue operation is launched and the last recorded ping is detected from Sands' phone. Saturday January 14 - Search efforts are halted due to risk from avalanches and adverse weather on local trails results in ground crews being pulled off the mountain in the evening. Sunday January 15 - Aerial searches, conducted by drones and helicopters, continue but nothing is found. Wednesday January 18 - A car believed to belong to Sands is found and towed away from a location by his family. Thursday January 19 - Weather conditions and avalanche risk continue to delay ground searches, although the sheriff's department says there is ""no hard deadline"" to call off the search. Friday January 20 - Federal and state authorities join the search for Sands using mobile phone forensics to help pinpoint the location of the actor. One week on from his disappearance, the sheriff's department says there is still ""no time set"" for when ground searches can continue. Monday January 23 - The actor's family releases a statement praising the ""heroic"" efforts of both local and out-of-county forces conducting the search efforts. Sands' family say they were ""deeply touched"" by the support they had received in the days since his disappearance. The sheriff's office also announces it is looking for a second missing hiker and that searches have allowed ground teams to conduct ""secondary"" sweeps of the area, but no evidence of the actor is found. Tuesday January 24 - The second hiker is found alive, but there is still no sign of Sands. Wednesday January 25 - Searches continue by air only, with authorities using special technology that can detect electronic devices and credit cards. San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department says it was ""hopeful"" that the technology will be able to more accurately pinpoint an area on which to focus efforts. Saturday January 28 - Kevin Ryan, Sands' hiking partner and close friend says he is ""remaining hopeful"" of the actor's safe return, as searches pass the two-week mark. Ryan tells PA it is obvious that ""something has gone wrong"" but that the actor's advanced experience and skill may allow him to overcome difficulty. Friday February 3 - The sheriff's department said conditions continued to be problematic after three weeks of searching, adding efforts have continued ""intermittently"". A spokesperson tells PA that efforts would normally be downgraded to a ""passive search"" after 10 days, but that plans have been extended due to the ongoing bad weather. Friday February 10 - Four weeks on from the first reports of Sands' disappearance, authorities admit the outcome of the search ""may not be what we would like"". The sheriff's department says it is still ""hopeful"" of finding the actor, but that conditions in the area remain dangerous, adding that ground searches are planned for the future. Monday February 13 - Exactly one month since Sands has been reported missing, weather conditions still hamper efforts to find him. Friday March 3 - Authorities temporarily close tourist resorts in the Mount Baldy area due to danger of avalanches. Snow storms batter the southern Californian region causing search efforts by both ground and air to be halted yet again. The majority of operations are suspended for the proceeding months with the sheriff's department unable to provide any further updates. Monday June 19 - The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department reports that a further ground search in the Mount Baldy wilderness has not yielded any results. The search, which took place on Saturday June 17, included more than 80 search-and-rescue volunteers, deputies, and staff, with efforts supported by two helicopters and drone crews. ""Despite the recent warmer weather, portions of the mountain remain inaccessible due to extreme alpine conditions,"" the department said. ""Multiple areas include steep terrain and ravines, which still have 10-plus feet of ice and snow."" Wednesday June 21 -Sands' family releases a second statement via the sheriff's department, saying they are continuing to keep the actor ""in our hearts with bright memories"", as searches continue. ""We are deeply grateful to the search teams and coordinators who have worked tirelessly to find Julian,"" the statement reads. ""We continue to hold Julian in our hearts with bright memories of him as a wonderful father, husband, explorer, lover of the natural world and the arts, and as an original and collaborative performer."" Saturday June 24 - Human remains are found in the Mount Baldy wilderness. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department says civilian hikers had contacted authorities on Saturday morning after finding the remains in area. The remains are transported to the Coroner's Office for identification. Tuesday June 27 - The sheriff's department announces the remains found are those are of Sands. Monday July 24 - Police say Sands' cause of death is ""undetermined"" due to the condition his body was found in.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RTRMADP_PEOPLE-JULIAN-SANDS_82555428_RC2XTY9HXB8T_2023-01-19T225917Zjpg-JS789740650.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/People_Julian_Sands_08087-95ea7jpg-JS826381348.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3bc12992-4441-4902-8713-c8ce2175b076-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NINTCHDBPICT000579621078-4.jpg",Mystery over Julian Sands’ cause of death as cops end their probe six months after actor vanished on mountain,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23150479/british-actor-julian-sands-cause-death/
"BRITISH tourists heading to Spain are being warned about a change in their hotel beds next month. Holidaymakers jetting to sunny hotspots like Majorca will be left without clean towels and bedsheets due to a strike set to start on August 1. Laundry workers in the Balearic Islands have announced an indefinite walkout beginning on August 1 in a row over pay. Union bosses say the £17.25  increase on offer, which would bring salaries up to £950 a month is not enough. Hotels in Ibiza, where most do their laundry in-house, are not expected to be massively affected. But unions are warning the other main Balearic Islands - Majorca and Minorca - will be badly hit if the strike starts as planned at 7am next Tuesday. Miguel Pardo, general secretary of the CCOO Habitat Balearas union, claimed hotels would be the first to suffer because minimum services workers would have to guarantee in any industrial action would be applied to essential services in places like hospitals. The union boss told the local press: ""It could be disastrous for tourism. ""It’s going to affect hotels full-on. There won’t be sheets or towels."" Around 1,500 laundry workers are expected to down tools unless a last-gasp arbitration meeting with bosses ends in an agreement being reached on pay and conditions. As well as wage increases, union chiefs are seeking improvements in regulated rest time and extra money for night work as well as a guaranteed two consecutive days off for their members each week. Mr Pardo claimed workers were being exploited and many were leaving to find new jobs. The two consecutive days off have been described as a “red line” by union chiefs. In August last year, just over two million foreign tourists visited the Balearic Islands, making it the most visited region in Spain by non-national holidaymakers. Just over 26 per cent of the foreign visitors were British, putting us in second place behind Germans who represented just over 28 per cent of the total. There has not yet been any official comment from hotel associations to the union claims a strike would be “disastrous” for tourism.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hands-hotel-maid-putting-flowers-833911878.jpg,Spain holiday warning as Brits face major changes to their hotel beds next month,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23170252/spain-holiday-warning-brits-face-major-changes-hotel-beds/
"DEVOTED Angela Berzeg was enjoying a dream retirement with her wealthy husband after his brilliant career as a top international economist. The couple had bought a £1million villa on an idyllic Turkish island and had another rustic holiday retreat from where they enjoyed scenic forest hikes. Angela, 80, and happy, healthy Korhan, 83, were reaping the fruits of his stellar career working for the Saudi and US governments , top banks and Istanbul University. But everything changed on the morning of Saturday, June 17. It was on that otherwise normal day that Korhan — a man with many friends and seemingly no enemies — vanished off the face of the Earth. He had headed out on his morning walk with his faithful three-year-old doberman pinscher Tina and adopted stray dog Esmeralda. But he never came home. Only Esmerelda showed up, all alone, some 20 minutes after they set off. The case is chillingly reminiscent of the disappearance of Nicola Bulley , 45, as she walked her dog in St Michael’s on Wyre, Lancs , earlier this year. A massive police search by more than 300 Turkish officers was launched for Korhan, backed by drones and dog teams. But there has been no trace of either the economics guru — nor Tina — since. And mystery deepened over Korhan’s baffling disappearance as the powerful government associations of his past fuelled a host of dark conspiracy theories and kidnap fears. In an anguished appeal for help finding her beloved husband, Angela, of Blandford, Dorset , said: “It is with a heavy heart and a growing sense of desperation that I implore each and every one reading this to lend your support in any way possible. “If anyone has even the slightest inkling of information — if you have seen or heard anything that could shed light on my husband’s disappearance — I beg you to come forward. “No detail is too small, every piece of information could hold the key to unravelling this bewildering mystery and restoring hope to our shattered lives. This past month has been an agonising journey of uncertainty and fear as we try to unravel the mystery that has befallen us. “We are left with countless unanswered questions and the weight of not knowing is unbearable.” In a direct appeal to her husband, she added: “Korhan, if you can hear my plea, know that your absence is felt deeply by all who love you. We will never stop searching, and we will never give up hope.” Korhan’s daughter Nisa, 50, of Shepherd’s Bush, West London , told how loved ones are distraught and baffled by her dad’s disappearance. She said: “None of it makes sense. My dad went off on his regular morning walk and never came back. “He was happy, carefree and healthy and loved his daily walks up hillside trails so much. He was as fit as a flea and a real mountain goat. “But that day last month, Esmerelda came back after 20 minutes alone and nothing has been found of my dad or Tina since. “It’s incredible that nothing — no clothing, a shoe, his glasses, a dog collar, nothing — has turned up. “The police have worked incredibly hard with teams of tracker and cadaver dogs and drones covering hundreds of square kilometres around the whole area. “But after more than a month they have not unearthed a single clue. “Police backed by commando units have scoured his route, as have searchers who know every inch of the area. And as time has gone on with no news, we have found ourselves concocting theories. “It’s upsetting to think of it but perhaps my dad and Tina have been taken somewhere by someone and that someone may have harmed them. “But why? Why would anyone hurt my elderly father years after his retirement? It just doesn’t add up. “Our concern is that this is a case more complicated than just someone missing in the woods.” Grandad-of-three Korhan and Angela loved life on the isle of Buyukada, off Istanbul, but were at their more modest rural retreat in the Marmara region when he vanished. He had headed out the door after breakfast at 8.30am for his regular, brisk, 40-minute stroll around a hilly forest trail near Armutlu Koyu with the dogs off the leash at his heels. His disappearance near Gönen, in western Turkey, echoes the UK case of tragic Nicola, whose mobile was found still connected to a call. But her pet, Willow, turned up unharmed on the day she went missing in January. Her body was found in the river three weeks later, a mile from where she vanished. A coroner has ruled she drowned by accident . Korhan’s beloved pooch Tina has become central to the Turkish hunt. Frantic Nisa, who has been out with sister Sibel, 56, conducting their own search of the forest route while calling their father’s name, said: “Tina’s disappearance has added to our concerns for our father. “She wasn’t an aggressive dog but she was loyal and would probably have stayed with him if he’d had a fall or an accident. And that would have made him easier to find. “Anyone who approached him meaning to harm him would have assumed his dog might protect him — and if Tina was unharmed, she would have been found by now. “So that’s led us to believe they may have both been taken somewhere. “Esmeralda came back only about 20 minutes after my dad set off, which suggests they had not walked far before becoming separated. “But why didn’t she vanish too? Parts of the track they were on is wide enough for a vehicle, which could have been used to take them away. “But yet again we ask ourselves who might do this — and why?” Police and army search teams working round the clock have now combed more than 200 square kilometres (77 sq miles) using specialist technology including infrared cameras. The only ravine where the sprightly grandad could possibly have fallen has been examined countless times. Turkish dog trainer Göktan Eker — a former police officer and trainer of military and cop dogs — said he believed Tina’s disappearance added to criminal fears. Eker, whose team of three search hounds have found nothing, said dobermans are highly intelligent, naturally protective and never leave their owner’s side, especially if they are injured. He added: “What has interested me since the beginning of the incident is that the dog is also missing. “It doesn’t make sense that they disappeared together. When a dog is lost in nature, it has a much better chance of survival than a human. “Tina would not have easily abandoned her owner and, if she had, we would have found her. This situation arouses criminal suspicion.” Korhan’s family have found themselves delving into his past for any clues which may help them solve the harrowing mystery. The brilliant scholar was born in Turkey but moved to the US after landing a place at a top high school, before studying economics at prestige universities Berkeley and Georgetown. He became a US citizen and went on to work for the World Bank in Washington, where he met and married Angela. More important posts followed as he scaled the career ladder, working for the US government in Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. He later switched to a high-powered role with the Joint Commission On Economic Coop- eration in capital Riyadh, advising the Saudis on how to shape their booming oil economy. He went on to take a job working directly for the Saudi government for three years, before moving back to the US. Korhan, a regular TV pundit, later lectured at Istanbul University while working at Alfa Menkul investment bank as chief economist until it went bust in 2005. It is his Saudi connections which have stirred up the darkest theories troubling his family as police continue to draw a blank. In 2018, outspoken Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi vanished without trace at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Turkey. The dissident journalist was lured there to collect marriage documents and ambushed by a 15-strong Saudi hit team , which tortured him to death and dismembered him. He was captured on CCTV entering — but not leaving — the building in Istanbul and no trace of him has ever been found. Horrific recordings were later reported to have emerged from inside the bugged building which captured him being cut to pieces with a bone saw while still alive. Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was alleged to have conspired to kill Jamal. He denied involvement. A US judge dismissed a lawsuit containing the claim, saying the prince was entitled to “sovereign immunity”. Anguished Nisa said: “We have naturally found ourselves looking at any possible link to the Saudis. “We understand why people might consider that after the Khashoggi case. But if they had any reason to harm him, it was something we were totally unaware of. “My father was an eminent economist who worked for the Saudis years ago, but was not an outspoken critic like Khashoggi. “It’s just another side to this case which is leading to more unanswered questions and all the time we can do nothing but wait for answers.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/korhan-angela-berzeg-retired-beautiful-833637215.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/e19ee4f2-28cd-4fe5-9992-16de24d4701d.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0fc20ff7-7441-46e3-a405-f4f217f38648.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/KH-COMP-P28-MAP-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nisa-berzeg-daughter-korhan-elder-833469904.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/korhan-berzeg-search-parties-taken-833659209.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-facebook-com-110365358290248-797481195.jpg",Inside the mystery of ‘Turkey’s Nicola Bulley’ who vanished on dog walk while living dream retirement with British wife,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23168271/korhan-berzeg-missing-turkey-dog-walk/
"A BRIDE-to-be tragically died after plunging from 100ft clifftop just moments after her boyfriend proposed. Yesim Demir, 39, and her boyfriend Nizamettin Gursu went over to a romantic spot at Polente Cape in Canakkale in Turkey , to watch the sunset. The pair chose the beauty spot as they wanted to celebrate their engagement. The man reportedly went back to the car to get a picnic, but said that he suddenly heard a scream. He rushed back, only to find that his new fiancee had tumbled off the cliff. The woman initially survived the 104ft plunge on the evening of July 6. But after 45 minutes of resuscitation efforts, medics declared her dead. Gursu told local media: ""We chose it to have a romantic memory after the proposal. We drank some alcohol . ""Everything happened at once. She lost her balance and fell down."" The authorities immediately closed off the area and opened an investigation, according to reports, with access to the cliff only being allowed again ""in a controlled manner."" One of Demir's friends told local media: ""This is a place where everyone comes and watches the sunset. ""However, the roads are very bad and there is no precaution on the edge of the cliff. ""A fence should be drawn here, precautions should be taken.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-yesim-demir-boyfriend-833882936.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d7d69d30-6543-4994-b31c-0d150cc1d2a3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-yesim-demir-undated-833882932.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-yesim-demir-boyfriend-833882859.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-yesim-demir-boyfriend-833882914.jpg",Bride-to-be dies in 100ft cliff plunge just moments after boyfriend proposes while watching the sunset,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23170710/bride-dies-cliff-plunge-boyfriend-proposes-sunset/
"STRANDED Brits angrily accused tour operators of dumping them in Rhodes while knowing it was being ravaged by forest fires. Up to 10,000 are still waiting for news after wildfires engulfed their hotels on the Greek holiday island — with Corfu the latest to evacuate tourists . Some have spent more than 48 hours in makeshift evacuation centres hastily set up as the inferno spread along the south coast. Mercy flights began to bring them home yesterday — with more expected today. But holidaymakers slammed airlines and travel firms for flying them to Rhodes in the first place. Mum Jane Allen, 49, flew from Manchester with package group TUI on Saturday evening — as thousands on the island were ordered to flee . She said: “We landed in Rhodes to utter chaos and were told our villa had been evacuated. “They knew what we were flying into, how serious it was. How could they?” Company director Mark Tonks, 57, said: “Why the hell were we allowed to take off when they knew what was unfolding?” An easyJet pilot warned his 37 passengers of the potential peril before the plane took off from Gatwick to Rhodes on Monday. He said travelling to the island for a holiday was a ""terrible idea"", explaining return flights are being managed by the military. Eight travellers, including a young boy in tears, took heed of his sobering words over the tannoy and disembarked the aircraft. Tourists spoke out as The Sun toured the charred remains of luxury beachfront hotels British holidaymakers fled from on Saturday. The kids’ play area at the Princess Andriana resort was reduced to burnt timber and twisted metal. Stephen Banks, 38, who was evacuated from the hotel with wife Naomi, 44, and their two kids, Charli and Sienna, said he was shocked at how fast the fire spread. Last night, after arriving home in Chester-le-Street, Co Durham , he said: “Thank God we got out when we did. I can’t begin to put into words how frightening it was, not just for us but the children.” Naomi, 44, added: “Our room overlooked the kids’ area — that’s how close it came to us. We were told to run as fast as we could. We left all our luggage behind.” Before and after pictures from the Lindos Imperial hotel showed the devastation caused by the fire . Glystra’s huge beach bar — a short distance from Kiotari — was a mangled mess of metal and smouldering wood. A local 19-year-old woman called Edisa said: “For the tourists, it was a terrifying experience, but for us, it’s worse because we live here. Everything is burned.” Kyriakos Sarikas, a hotel boss in Lindos, said: “It’s like a biblical catastrophe.” The Sun witnessed the carnage along the coastline — as the UK Government faced calls to advise against “all but essential travel to Rhodes”. Roadblocks were set up by Greek cops as the fires continued to rage. We were given special permission to capture the impact of the wildfire — which saw 19,000 displaced in hours. As we drove south, we stopped at a viewing point overlooking the village of Malonas. Dozens of locals stood aghast as plumes of dense black smoke drifted from the mountains beyond. Helicopters and planes worked in relay to douse the flames with sea water. Gusts of wind — fanning the flames — whipped up the gravel beneath our feet. We continued on into the valley and beyond and watched heroic firefighters battling the flames — and volunteers being ferried to and from the blaze on pick-up trucks. Electrical wires hung loosely from burned telegraph poles. Lampposts were twisted by the intensity of the blaze. Burnt out cars and dead mountain goats littered the roadside, while rescuers managed to save some rabbits and other wildlife. Fire alarms at gutted coffee shops were still ringing out as the smoke hit the back of our throats. One cop at a roadblock said: “The winds are changing the direction of the fire all of the time.” As power cuts plunged parts of the island into darkness last night, Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned there were “three difficult days ahead” before temperatures are expected to drop. Last night, TUI said it had cancelled all flights to Rhodes until Friday. Those evacuated accused the firm of “abandoning” them. Holidaymakers were asked to decide if they wanted to stay in the slim chance they could continue their holidays — or add their name to a list to be repatriated. One who chose to go home said she received a text to say a bus would take her to the airport. The message arrived at 1.56am — 16 minutes after the transport had left. A Rapid Deployment Team from the Foreign Office is now on the ground as Brits head to the airport in a desperate bid to get a flight. Those lucky enough to get home on mercy flights described the rescue effort as a “free-for-all” as they landed at Gatwick . Last night, The Association of British Travel Agents said: “We understand some resorts have had their evacuation order removed by the Greek authorities and people have been advised they can return to the resorts of Lindos, Pefkos and Kalathos.” Coach operator National Express is offering free travel to Greek holidaymakers repatriated to a different airport from which they departed. Boss Chris Hardy said: “This is the least we can do to help.” By Lisa Minot THE Rhodes fires have seen tens of thousands of tourists stranded or fleeing flames. The fearful scenes will have had a huge impact on those due to visit the island. And news that Corfu and now Crete are also ablaze will be causing extra worry. Q: I am due to visit Rhodes this week with a tour firm — what is the situation? A: Jet2 has cancelled all trips to Rhodes until Sunday, and affected customers will receive a full refund or re-booking. Meanwhile, TUI has cancelled all trips until Friday and until Sunday for those visiting hotels in the affected region. EasyJet has also cancelled all package holidays until today. Q: What if I booked my trip independently? A: British Airways is running a full schedule to Rhodes but offers customers the chance to amend their bookings or postpone them free of charge. Ryanair is running flights as normal and anyone not wishing to travel will lose their money. Q: Now Corfu has wildfires impacting tourist destinations, what if I am travelling there? A: On Sunday, TUI told customers going to four hotels near the fires not to travel, but to contact the firm to discuss their options. As yet, other tour operators have not cancelled trips. Q: I am going to Greece soon but the fires are a worry — can I cancel and get my money back? A: Unless the Government issues official advice warning against all but essential travel to the areas affected, you would lose your money if you choose not to go on holiday. By James Cleverly, Foreign Secretary I WANTED to let Sun readers and others whose holiday has been ruined by fires know that I really feel for you. Our top priority is making sure you are safe. We’ve been speaking to the Greeks to make sure that’s happening. We also want to ensure the airlines and travel firms are doing what they can to get you home without fuss. We’ve got people helping out Brits at the airport and I’ve got my team in the UK working round the clock.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tourists-sleep-wait-departing-planes-833751794-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7c0684ba-f7f4-49a5-b0e0-63f8312e2943.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0da4e874-8c84-42f9-a959-b8fc1cd27cc7.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833912475.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833895566.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833894035.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833897063-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefighting-helicopter-makes-water-drop-833875477.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fireman-gestures-holds-cat-two-833890368.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-shows-view-burned-buildings-833911842.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833912589-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833895212.jpg","Tour operators dumped us in Rhodes despite knowing about wildfires, claim terrified Brits as inferno continues to rage",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23170670/rhodes-wildfires-stranded-brits-tour-operators/
"SMITH & Wesson revolver-owning Spanish far-right leader Santiago Abascal likes to trot around on horseback spouting his firebrand rhetoric. Seen as his nation’s Donald Trump , he is keen to wrest Gibraltar from British hands and has called for an end to the “Muslim occupation” of Spain . The Vox Party leader was heralded as Spain’s potential political kingmaker before Sunday’s general election delivered a hung parliament. Vox actually lost seats compared to 2019 yet it’s still Spain’s third biggest party, attracting around three million votes. The snap election was called by prime minister Pedro Sánchez after his Socialist Workers’ Party did badly in May’s local elections. But it was the conservative People’s Party which emerged as the largest party — although, even with the support of Vox, it was still seven seats short of a parliamentary majority. Spain has now been plunged into uncertainty, with fresh elections before the end of the year being mooted as a way to solve the parliamentary log jam. Abascal’s Vox Party would again position themselves as possible partners in a Spanish government. It would be the first far-right party in power since the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975. As many as 200,000 political dissidents were executed by the dictator’s militias — and 400,000 others were held in jails and concentration camps. Many died of malnutrition. Some believe Spain’s summer election in sweltering heat has left Vox withering on the vine. However, the lesson from across Europe is that the pernicious far right is resilient — and resurgent. Parties from across the continent which recently would have been seen as beyond the pale are now becoming part of the political mainstream. From Sweden and Finland in the north to Italy and Greece in south — and in the EU’s powerhouses Germany and France — the far right is on the march. There is no 1930s-style click of jackboots on cobblestones across the continent. Instead, sharp-suited politicos dress up extreme policy in populist soundbites. The new-found popularity of the far right taps into fears on uncontrolled immigration, national identity, culture wars and the cost of green policies . In Sweden — once regarded as a bastion of liberalism — a party with neo-Nazi roots now props up a centre-right coalition. The eurosceptic Sweden Democrats — which came second in 2022 elections — rejects the far right label. Its leader Jimmie Akesson once called his nation’s Muslim population “the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War”. His party, which began in 1988, grew from white supremacist roots before trading bovver boots for business suits to harness democratic respectability. After winning 20.5 per cent of the vote at last year’s general election, the SD’s policy demands included a halt to all immigration, the immediate deportation of convicted foreign criminals and a ban on begging. Meanwhile, in fellow Nordic nation Finland, its new right-wing government was rocked by revelations that far-right Finns party leader and finance minister Riikka Purra had written racist blog posts. She admitted writing in 2008: “Anyone feel like spitting on beggars and beating (N-word) children today in Helsinki?” It was just the latest scandal to hit the party that is, astonishingly, the second biggest in the Finnish parliament. Last month another Finns party minister, Vilhelm Junnila, resigned after it emerged he had given a speech at an event attended by neo-Nazis and called for African women to have abortions to combat the climate crisis. On Europe’s southern shores, far-right parties won almost 13 per cent of the vote in last month’s Greek general election. New party The Spartans — seen as a direct descendant of the outlawed neo-Nazi Golden Dawn — gained 12 seats in Greece’s 300-seat parliament. One Greek newspaper said the elections “have produced the darkest result of the last half-century”. Across the Ionian Sea, Giorgia Meloni , whose Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, is prime minister of Italy. And in France — the EU’s lodestar — National Rally leader Marine Le Pen is riding a wave of support following violent protests across the nation. Covering last year’s presidential elections — in which Le Pen won a record 41 per cent of the vote — I was astonished by the large number of young people at her rallies. Perhaps most surprising of all is the rise of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland in Germany , a nation which has done so much to learn the lessons of its extremist past. In a “watershed moment”, the far-right AfD won its first district council election in June. The party has surged in the polls in the past year from ten per cent to 20 per cent, making it Germany’s second most popular — ahead of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centre-left SPD. Far right expert Catherine Fieschi, from the Open Society Foundations Europe, said: “After every crisis we have told ourselves that the populists and far right are waning in Europe. “And the fact is they have been rising more or less steadily, with a few interruptions, since the 1980s. “They are really now a part of the landscape.” It is a lesson those writing off Spain’s Vox should heed wisely.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candidate-spains-prime-minister-far-832808503.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000758214224.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dd69ae16-7074-4655-838d-6ee04d565c04.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2r8em8e-riikka-purra-campaigning-panel-833914732.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0e358fe0-21d2-45f6-a09d-4771a0524510.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/33fe694d-193f-4041-b28f-c9617d9a72b2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-newly-elected-greek-government-830424279.jpg",How European far-right leaders are marching to power as Spanish ‘Trump’ waits in wings,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23170602/european-far-right-marching-power-spanish-trump/
"HOLIDAYMAKER Caroline Smith slept through the biggest evacuation in Greek history - after she popped in her ear plugs before bed. Snoozing Caroline, 49, missed scores of emergency texts issued by authorities on the island of Rhodes , 20 voicemails from worried pals and 10 calls from her hotel reception. She only woke up after the Greek manager at Lindos White Suites kicked her door down. Personal assistant Caroline, who flew home to Swansea yesterday, told The Sun: “I have always worn ear plugs because my husband snores. “On Saturday night, I’d been out for dinner but didn’t have too much to drink because it was so hot. “I got back to my room, got ready for bed and put my ear plugs in. I was dead to the world. Nothing was going to wake me up. “My friends called 20 times. The hotel reception tried 10 times. I just slept through it all. “The only reason I woke up is the hotel manager was kicking my door in at 3.30am.” Drowsy Caroline walked through the lifeless hotel complex towards the beach where hundreds had gathered as the fires raged - oblivious to the panic that had unfolded over the hours before. She added: “I was out for the count. “Everyone has been saying how tired they, that they’ve had no sleep. They all look exhausted. “Luckily, I got an extra couple of hours.” Caroline, who was on holiday with six pals located on the other side of the hotel complex, was evacuated to a nearby school in Lindos before being taken to another nearby on Sunday. She finally boarded a flight home yesterday - adding: “I’m looking forward to sleeping in my own bed.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-caroline-smith-833859988.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefighting-helicopter-makes-water-drop-833875477-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/98d646c1-9e5e-4e1a-8625-ca27e863cc55.jpg",British tourist slept through Rhodes wildfire evacuation — after popping in ear plugs before bed,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23171109/holidaymaker-slept-through-evacuation-rhodes-fires/

The woman celebrated her win with a nice cup of tea after discovering she scooped the $1.3million jackpot on TattsLotto.

"A NEWLYWED couple told of their ""trauma"" after fleeing their Rhodes honeymoon when wildfires took hold. Claire and Paul Jones were forced to evacuate their hotel within ten minutes as the blaze ripped through their resort in Lindos. The couple, both 36 from Leicestershire , arrived in Rhodes On July 18, after getting married two days earlier. Claire recalled sitting outside having drinks with her husband when it ""got really smoky""  with ""ash dropping out of the sky"". She said the following day, the pair were evacuated by coach from the Village Rhodes Beach Resort near Lardos after the situation went from ""zero to 100"". She said: ""That's how quickly it escalates, it was literally zero to 100. ""By the time we got our stuff and got to reception, which was probably another ten minutes, everybody was at reception and you could see the fires. ""They had come over the hill, they were halfway down the hill, and everybody was just panicking."" She said she and her husband were ""very lucky"" as they have now managed to flee via a taxi to Faliraki in the north of the island, where they had planned to stay later in their trip. ""I'm finding it really hard to just switch off, I can't stop thinking about it,"" she added. ""I keep thinking of little things, like there was a little girl on the bus screaming to her mum, 'I don't want to die'. ""The kids were petrified because they could see the fire, it wasn't a nice situation."" Mrs Jones said as they fled they were given wet towels by the staff at the hotel because ""the smoke had got so intense you could hardly breathe"". While waiting for the coaches to arrive, Mrs Jones recalled: ""When we got to the car park and you could see the fires getting closer and closer and closer, and the coaches weren't turning up... that was really worrying."" She added: ""When we first got on the coach, that was the most scary because I thought, if that wind blows towards us, that fire is going to hit the coach. ""We had to drive through two or three fires on either side of the road, there was no way out, we had to drive through them. ""It was really quite traumatic driving to where we went because you could see everyone fleeing their hotels, and people were walking along the beaches, walking along the roads, and they had babies and small children."" Mrs Jones said they were driven to a beach where they waited for around two hours watching the fires getting ""closer and closer"" before several boats started to pull up on the beach. ""There were loads of people getting dropped off,"" she said. ""There was no one from the hotel, there were no holiday reps that we know of, no one knew what was going on. ""You could see the fire getting closer and closer, and then they [the boats] started pulling up on the beach, obviously just people helping. ""People were very wary because there one no one guiding the situation, but we just made the decision to get on one."" After they had arrived in Lindos Bay, Mrs Jones said she and her husband fled via a taxi to Faliraki. Thousands of Brit holidaymakers were forced to evacuate as the blaze continues to spread across Rhodes. The fire-hit island has been ravaged by flames that have destroyed land, properties and wildlife. The wildfires sent thousands of locals and tourists to flee - in Greece's biggest evacuation effort.

"POLICE have arrested a doctor and his daughter after the headless body of a naked man was found in a notorious Japan ""love hotel"". Stunned staff at the Let’s Susukino Hotel in Sapporo discovered the decapitated corpse of Hitoshi Ura, 62. A worker stumbled across the gruesome scene in the second floor room on July 2 after Ura did not check out by the afternoon. His naked body was sprawled across the floor of the bathroom - but his head was nowhere to be found. Ura's frantic wife had reported him missing on the same day. Psychiatrist Osamu Tamura, 59, and his daughter Runa, 29, have now been arrested on suspicion of being involved in his murder, according to local news. The father and daughter were reportedly detained on Monday in connection with the brutal beheading. Cops are now working to establish the relationship between the pair and Ura, as well as a possible motive. Police told Japanese newspaper The Mainichi that it is believed Runa was acquainted with the victim. However, they have not yet revealed whether she or her dad have pleaded guilty to any of the allegations. Investigators claim Ura and another individual checked into the hotel at around 10.50pm on July 1. Although he never emerged, his companion is said to have departed the accommodation at 2am. According to Japan Today , the suspect was seen leaving the hotel carrying a black suitcase on CCTV footage. Police said the person accompanying Ura was small, sporting light-coloured women's clothing and a wide-brimmed hat. But when they left the "" love hotel "", the person appeared to have ditched their get-up and were instead dressed in black. Cops suspect that Osamu, employed at a hospital in Sapporo, dropped off and collected his daughter at the hotel, but say he did not enter the building. An autopsy on Ura's mutilated body found his cause of death was haemorrhagic shock as a result of blood loss from stab wounds. His head had been sawn off with a blade, then taken from the scene. The incident occurred in the bustling entertainment district of Susukino, where many of the city's "" love hotels "" are located. Guests are given privacy to engage in intimate activities and have gained notoriety as ""hook-up"" spots in Japan.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-japanese-police-said-tuesday-833971950.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/headless-body-man-found-sapporo-833984166-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833984015.jpg",Hotel horror after staff find headless man’s body stripped naked in room as doctor and daughter arrested in Japan,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23172048/headless-man-hotel-doctor-daughter-arrested-japan/
"TOURISTS got off a flight to Rhodes after the pilot warned them it was a ""terrible idea"" to travel there as the island continues to be ravaged by forest fires. The plane was just about to take off from Gatwick when the easyJet captain urged the 37 British holidaymakers on board to think twice about their trip to the Greek holiday island . He said travelling to the island for a holiday was a ""bad idea"", explaining return flights are being managed by the military. Speaking over the tannoy, the pilot said: ""Travelling to Rhodes for a holiday at the moment is a terrible idea. ""As far as I'm concerned, this flight is being operated on an emergency basis. ""Return flights are now being managed by the military. If you want to get off flight, you are welcome to do so. ""I don't know in what capacity you are travelling, but if you are travelling for leisure, my sincere recommendation is it's a bad idea."" But only eight travellers, including a young boy in tears, took heed of his sobering words and disembarked the aircraft, BBC Wales reported. And just 42 hotels in Rhodes have closed as many in unaffected parts of the island continue with their breaks and authorities in Greece insist tourists should still fly out. Olga Kefalogianni, Tourism Minister for Greece, said there ""has been no disruption in the airport"", insisting only up to 20 per cent of the island has been hit by fires. It comes as up to 10,000 stranded Brits wait for news after wildfires engulfed their hotels in Rhodes — with Corfu the latest to evacuate tourists . Many have angrily accused tour operators of dumping them on the island while knowing it was being destroyed by forest fires . Some have spent more than 48 hours in makeshift evacuation centres hastily set up as the inferno spread along the south coast. Mercy flights began to bring them home yesterday — with more expected today. But holidaymakers slammed airlines and travel firms for flying them to Rhodes in the first place. Mum Jane Allen, 49, flew from Manchester with package group TUI on Saturday evening — as thousands on the island were ordered to flee . She said: “We landed in Rhodes to utter chaos and were told our villa had been evacuated. “They knew what we were flying into, how serious it was. How could they?” By Lisa Minot THE Rhodes fires have seen tens of thousands of tourists stranded or fleeing flames. The fearful scenes will have had a huge impact on those due to visit the island. And news that Corfu and now Crete are also ablaze will be causing extra worry. Q: I am due to visit Rhodes this week with a tour firm — what is the situation? A: Jet2 has cancelled all trips to Rhodes until Sunday, and affected customers will receive a full refund or re-booking. Meanwhile, TUI has cancelled all trips until Friday and until Sunday for those visiting hotels in the affected region. EasyJet has also cancelled all package holidays until today. Q: What if I booked my trip independently? A: British Airways is running a full schedule to Rhodes but offers customers the chance to amend their bookings or postpone them free of charge. Ryanair is running flights as normal and anyone not wishing to travel will lose their money. Q: Now Corfu has wildfires impacting tourist destinations, what if I am travelling there? A: On Sunday, TUI told customers going to four hotels near the fires not to travel, but to contact the firm to discuss their options. As yet, other tour operators have not cancelled trips. Q: I am going to Greece soon but the fires are a worry — can I cancel and get my money back? A: Unless the Government issues official advice warning against all but essential travel to the areas affected, you would lose your money if you choose not to go on holiday. Some 20,000 people had to leave homes and hotels over the weekend as the inferno spread and reached coastal resorts on the verdant island's southeast, after charring swathes of land and damaging buildings. Firefighters on the island are still battling the flames as thousands of people have been forced to evacuate burning hotels , with tourists scrambling to get home on evacuation flights. The deputy mayor of Rhodes, Konstantinos Taraslias, said the fires are still burning out of control after seven days of fighting them. More than 16,000 people have been evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels .

The video starts with holidaymakers relaxing by the pool at the luxury Lindos Imperial Resort and Spa, in the village of Kiotari.

"BRITS headed for summer holidays in Spain have been warned of a mystery substance that has forced four top beaches to close. Red flags have been raised to prohibit swimming along the coast of the holiday hotspot resort of El Puig, near Valencia after a strange white matter washed up. The town council made the decision to shut the beaches of Medicalia, Puig Val, Old Fishermen's Quarter and Els Plans on Saturday after alerts of a mystery substance. A thick, grainy, white substance has coated the beaches in the area - and authorities have no idea what it is. Maritime experts are now taking samples to analyse the substance ""as soon as possible"", La Vanguardia reports. The council said: ""We understand that this decision can be inconvenient for lovers of our beaches, but everyone's safety is our priority."" The beaches should remain close until the investigations have deemed the substance as safe. The investigators are speculating it may be a spill from a ship that was sailing nearby, according to local media . Authorities have also raised the red flags on the nearby sandbanks of Pobla de Farnals and Massamagrell. Only half an hour down the coast, tourists and locals alike were devastated by last week's news of a summer shutdown of a favourite beach - L'Arbre del Gos . The sandy Spanish hotspot will reportedly be closed from August 15 and fenced off in 200m sections while the local council performs a £24million anti-coastal erosion project. Meanwhile, a beloved Ibiza beach was closed indefinitely on July 20 after officials made a deadly discovery. The sands of s'Aigua Blanca had been ruled a danger to the public following a spat of powerful waves and stormy weather . Last month, Brit holidaymakers were warned of a beach closure in the popular area of Alicante .

"THE wildfire risk alerts have been raised to ""extreme"" and ""very high"" in areas of Majorca, Ibiza and Menorca. The high temperatures of recent days have put the popular Spanish islands at risk, while large parts of Greece and Italy continued to battle vicious wildfires. According to Spain's meteorological agency AEMET, the ""extreme"" red alert covers the southern tip and eastern coast of Majorca near to the main resorts of Magaluf , Palmanova and Santa Ponsa. Ibiza and Menorca are also on ""high"" fire risk alert. The scorching hot temperatures throughout the last days have turned Majorca into a ""tinder box"", firefighters told Majorca Daily Bulletin. However, the island is reportedly well-prepared for wildfires with the fire brigade, planes and helicopters ready and waiting in the wings. It comes as Brit tourists were warned of an ""extreme fire risk"" in Crete as Greek authorities issued a red alert for the holiday hotspot areas of Rethymnon, Heraklion, and Lasithi. The Balearic islands and Crete could be facing the same fate as Rhodes and Corfu, which have seen extraordinary blazes sweep across the islands - causing thousands to flee. And in the popular Italian island of Sicily, Palermo airport was forced to close today due to fires burning dangerously close to its runways. The airport in the Sicilian capital was forced to shut until 11am local time, its operator said on Twitter , as firefighters worked to put out a major blaze. Yesterday, locals and tourists were being evacuated from large swaths of Corfu as more blazes rip through the country. Today, two more Greek resorts of Evia and Agioi are being evacuated as the wildfires continue to sweep across the country. Holidaymakers have now been told to evacuate Agioi Theodoroi and parts of Evia, Greece ’s second-largest island, after forest fires erupted in the areas.

"TOURISTS have been urged to stay indoors as temperatures are set to hit a sweltering 46C in Greece. Forecasters have warned of a fresh heatwave hitting the already scorching country which has faced days of devastating wildfires . The Emergency Bulletin of Dangerous Weather Phenomena has said temperatures could reach highs of 44C today in Thessaly and Central Greece . And on Wednesday, temperatures are due to rocket to 46C in Peloponnese, in the country's south. Authorities have warned holidaymakers to stay inside and use air conditioners or fans to stay cool. Civil protection officials are urging people to be ""particularly careful"" and to take ""self-protection measures"" against the heat. They urge everyone in Greece to stay in ""cool and shady places"" while using air-con and fans. Officials urge people to avoid sunbathing and walking outside - and if you must, make sure you wear a hat, sunglasses and light clothes. People should eat light meals with fruits and vegetables, and drink plenty of water and juice. Booze should also be avoided, along with high-fat foods. Greek officials added: ""Special care is recommended for babies and young children, as well as the elderly and those with chronic diseases to protect them from high temperatures."" But then there will be respite as the temperature is predicted to ""drop significantly"" on Thursday.

Lifeguards rushed to raise a red flag to warn beachgoers after noticing the blue shark lurking in the Pyrénées-Orientales, which borders the Mediterranean Sea . Dramatic video shows the animal swimming just 100 metres offshore as crowds gathered on the safety of the sand to watch the spectacle. Its dorsal fin can be seen ominously rising above the waves as terrified onlookers gasped and screamed. The sea was evacuated by eagle-eyed lifeguards as a precaution after a ""dark shape"" was spotted in the water. David Simian, the chief lifeguard in Barcarès, told The Times : ""Lifeguards took a boat out and saw it was a shark. ""It was a blue shark that is no threat to humans."" He explained that holidaymakers were ushered out of the sea to ""avoid accidents and panic"" as well as to protect the shark. One tourist said she was in a nearby restaurant when she heard the commotion unfold on the beach as people shrieked: ""Shark, shark!"" She described how ""all of a sudden people started screaming in all directions"" when the animal began its approach. Although sightings of blue sharks are common during the reproductive season, they usually do not swim so close to the shore. Victor Salvat, another lifeguard at Barcarès, told local radio it was the first time he had seen a shark in the Mediterranean. He said the creature was ""really calm"" when they approached on the boat to confirm its identity, adding that it wasn't even spooked by the noise of the engine. Victor continued: ""We watched it for about five minutes. It circled around us and it was about two metres long. ""At one point, it ended up under the dinghy, you could see its mouth and tail at the same time, so it was quite big. It was all black. ""It was really calm."" According to local media, swimming was banned at the beach for one hour before lifeguards deemed the water safe to enter. At least 47 shark species are known to call the coast of mainland France home, with the majority not posing a threat to humans. But the beasts seem to be getting bolder - as tourists across Spain have been forced to bolt out of the sea to avoid sharks over the summer. The holiday hotspot has been swarmed by sea creatures in recent weeks , forcing some to temporarily close. Beachgoers in the small resort town of La Antilla were in a panic after spotting a fin poking above the waves - but police said the surprise guest on the shoreline was a Cuvier's beaked whale. Last month, families were seen frantically running through waist-high water as a shark swam up beside them off a Costa Blanca beach. Days later, a blue shark sparked panic at Aguamarina beach in Orihuela Costa south of Alicante. A shark was then spotted gliding through the water off a beach in Ibiza - marking the fifth sighting in Spain in just a week . Terrifying footage later emerged of another shark nearing the sands in Malaga , forcing Brits to flee to the shore. The Patalavaca beach in Mogan, Gran Canaria , was then closed after two hammerhead sharks were spotted prowling near the coast.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/777a2952-8e49-4e70-af40-496b9ac26b1c.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a9e7a205-631f-4972-a041-db14b2db6812.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cdbce881-f31d-43fe-82fb-3857a9c97a5d.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/830d6987-9b21-421f-9ce8-4ca0e0dd5244.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4f1d075b-51a4-4954-836f-37e40817817b.jpg",Terrifying moment massive SHARK seen lurking off French beach sending tourists scrambling out of the sea,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23177278/massive-shark-lurking-french-beach-tourists-flee/
"A MAN tried to kidnap a toddler twice on a beach in Ibiza before being arrested by an off-duty cop, police have said. The Moroccan national was snared after the policeman heard the two-year-old girl's mum screaming on Talamanca beach. Spanish detectives say the man kissed the tot after grabbing hold of her. She was then rescued by her mum, who took her to another spot on the beach. But he then picked the youngster up again and took her into the sea. Her terrified mum started screaming - grabbing the attention of an off-duty cop who rushed to help. The man put up resistance before he arrest was arrested following the horrifying incident last Wednesday at around 12.30pm, police said. A spokesman for the National Police in the Balearic Islands said: “Officers have arrested a Moroccan man as the suspected author of a crime of unlawful detention, sexual assault, resisting arrest and disobedience, after he tried to take a two-year-old girl on a beach in Ibiza who he kissed on the face. “The man, without apparent motive, grabbed hold of the girl and starting kissing her on the cheek and stopping her from escaping. “At that moment the girl’s mum grabbed hold of her daughter and freed her from the man’s grip. “She went to another spot on the beach which was a fair distance from where they had been sitting and the man came up to them and grabbed hold of the girl again and went into the sea with her. “The youngster’s mum started yelling because the man was ignoring her and wouldn’t let go of her daughter. “At that point an off-duty police officer who was on the beach and heard the mum’s screams came to help and managed to reunite the mum with her daughter. “He ordered the man to move away several times but the man adopted a violent attitude and threw himself on the off-duty police officer who had to reduce him and retain him until more police help arrived. “The suspect was arrested for alleged unlawful detention of a minor as well as for crimes of sexual assault, resistance and disobedience.” Police in Ibiza have not revealed the nationality of the mum or her toddler. It was not immediately clear today if the man has already appeared before a judge and been bailed or remanded in custody.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ftg2n7-talamanca-beach-ibiza-eivissa-834053565.jpg,"Man ‘snatched girl, 2, from Ibiza beach TWICE’ before being arrested by off-duty cop who heard mum’s screams",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23178774/fiend-snatched-girl-ibiza-beach/
"CHILLING images showed a man carrying his sister's severed head in a bag after killing her for trying to marry against his wishes. Aashifa's elopement sparked fury in her brother Riyaz, 22, who murdered the 18-year-old in an ""honour killing"". Horrifying footage showed the 22-year-old walking towards Fatehpur police station, India , carrying Aashifa's head. Villagers spotted him with the blood-soaked bag and reported him to the cops. Riyaz was then arrested and sent to jail. Aashifa had wanted to marry a man of her choice but her Riyaz and their father Abdul Rashid were against it. On May 29, Abdul filed a complaint with cops against his sister's partner, Chand Babu, under a charge of abducting a woman to marry. Chand was then arrested and sent to jail while she was ""returned"" to her family home. On July 20, when the young woman made it clear to her family that she would like to marry Chand, Riyaz became violent. Barabanki additional superintendent of police Ashutosh Mishra said: ""In a fit of rage Riyaz picked up a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded his sister before packing her head in a sack and going to the police station."" Local media reported that an autopsy was carried out following Aashifa's murder and gathered evidence from the scene. The brutal murder sparked outrage across the country and reignited fury over the lengths men will go to control the women in their family, The Economic Times reported. Human rights groups say thousands of women and girls are killed across South Asia and the Middle East each year by family members angered at perceived damage to their ""honour"". In India, any honour-based crime with an intention to suppress a person's choice to love or marry is illegal. Perceived offences can include eloping, fraternising with men, or any transgression of staunchly conservative values regarding women. India officially recorded 24 honour killings in 2019 , but campaigners say government statistics on honour killing mask the true scale of the crime, with women at greater risk than men.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/horror-sight-chilling-moment-man-834036513-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/horror-sight-chilling-moment-man-834036505.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/horror-sight-chilling-moment-man-834036512-1.jpg",Chilling moment man carries his sister’s severed head in street after killing her for trying to marry against his wishes,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23178176/man-carries-sisters-severed-head-after-killing-her/
"THIS incredible neighbourhood of 300 luxury homes in China is connected by a giant snaking swimming pool nearly a mile long. The remarkable resort in Yingde, Guangdong, is dubbed ""China's Venice "" because of its canal-style feature weaving between rows of houses. Called the Baodun Lake Hushan Hot Spring Resort, the 300-villa accommodation is surrounded by mountains, rivers and forests. But all of the five-star villas each have a balcony that overlooks the gigantic blue pool that winds between the rows of buildings. Each villa is directly connected to the pool with visitors having to swim or take a gondola if they want to get around. The swimming lane which stretches from the backyard of each building in the resort is 4 meters wide, 1.2 meters deep, and 1.3km long. The massive man-made canal snakes past the luxury resorts and is surrounded by green palm trees - making it a desirable place for travellers. Footage of the stunning resort often shows several families dotted around the pool with colourful swim rings and inflatable toys as they enjoy the bizarre feature on their doorstep. On Trip.com the resort has racked up a mega 4.6 star rating with over 3,600 positive reviews. One wrote: ""We managed to enjoy 2 days of swimming around the hotel lanes which was really fun! Unlimited swimming, hot springs and sauna"". Another said: ""The swimming lanes of the hotel are fun for both adults and children. The swimming lanes are open until 11 pm. There are also many water toys for free"". A third commented: ""The water quality in the swimming lane is good, and there are toys, children have fun"". But even though the resort looks as if it has been plucked straight out of Italy, not everyone online has been left impressed by the mega-pool. “The whole community’s going to be peeing in there, nah I’m good,” one bloke said. Another pointed out the maintenance a pool like that would require, saying “cleaning it has got to suck”.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taken-without-permission-yingde-baodun-834004413.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/uk-trip-com-hotels-yingde-834004743.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dfaa5cd6-73c3-43a2-b5ec-3e6d07cc8310.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taken-without-permission-yingde-baodun-834004424.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taken-without-permission-yingde-baodun-834004431.jpg",Inside incredible 300-home neighbourhood connected by one giant MILE LONG swimming pool in ‘China’s Venice’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23173911/inside-300-home-neighbourhood-connected-giant-swimming-pool-china/
"TWO air force pilots died when their firefighting plane clipped a tree and crashed while battling a wildfire in Greece today. Horror footage shows the aircraft plunging into a hillside as thousands continue to be evacuated from holiday resorts. Christos Moulas, 34, and Periklis Stefanidis, 27, were sent to douse scrub fires near Platanistos at the southern tip of Evia island. Footage shows their yellow Canadair CL-215 plane swooping low to dump water on smouldering bushes. But it clips a tree, and a piece of wing believed to be a flap or other control surface is seen falling to the ground. Seconds later the firefighting plane rolls over and nosedives towards the ground. The pilot is unable to pull out of the dive and the aircraft is seen vanishing behind a ridge, followed by a fireball explosion and cloud of smoke. Helicopter that were also fighting fires nearby flew to the scene of the crash, near the coastal town of Karystos. One dropped water to douse the flaming wreckage, and another reportedly landed to check on the crew. An eyewitness told local media: ""I saw it pass me at a 90 degree angle. ""I thought, 'What is he doing?'. I considered it to have taken a dangerous flight slope. ""In three seconds I heard the explosion. It was immediately engulfed in flames."" He said two small blazes were sparked by crash but nearby fire engines immediately rushed to put them out. Holidaymakers have been told to evacuate parts of Evia, Greece’s second-largest island, after forest fires erupted in the areas. Evacuations were also underway today in the resort of Agioi Theodoroi near Athens. It comes as thousands of Brits were flown back from fire-ravaged Rhodes - with many more facing their summer holidays being cancelled. As many as 10,000 Britons were estimated to be on the island, a favourite tourist destination, the Foreign Office said. Some 20,000 people had to leave homes and hotels over the weekend as the inferno spread across Rhodes, after charring swathes of land and damaging buildings. Meanwhile, several tourists got off a flight heading to Rhodes after the pilot warned them it was a ""terrible idea"" to travel there. The plane was just about to take off from Gatwick when the easyJet captain urged the 37 British holidaymakers on board to think twice about their trip. He said travelling to the island for a holiday was a ""bad idea"", explaining return flights are being managed by the military. Eight travellers, including a young boy in tears, took heed of his sobering words and disembarked the aircraft, BBC Wales reported. Firefighters on the island are still battling the flames as thousands of people have been forced to evacuate burning hotels , with tourists scrambling to get home on evacuation flights. The deputy mayor of Rhodes, Konstantinos Taraslias, said the fires are still burning out of control after seven days of fighting them. Wildfires are also raging on the island of Corfu , off the west coast of Greece, and tourists have been warned of an ""extreme fire risk"" in Crete . Temperatures have risen above 40C in parts of Greece, with a new evacuation warning being issued for the village of Vati in Rhodes. More than 16,000 people have been so far evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ring-plane.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aircraft-involved-fighting-wildfires-greece-834043710-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aircraft-involved-fighting-wildfires-greece-834043849.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-two-pilots-died-plane-834074374.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pilot-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefighter-stands-next-fire-truck-834029801.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefighting-plane-makes-water-drop-834033358.jpg",Firefighting plane crashes while dousing blaze on Greek island as horror footage shows it clip tree and plunge into hill,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23179607/firefighter-plane-crashes-while-battling-wildfires-on-greek/
"THE owners of a hulking six-foot dog who doesn't realise his size have told how he was booted out of puppy school for sitting on other pooches. One-year-old Newfoundland Franklyn weighs a whopping nine stone but thinks he is still a lapdog - so he continues to act like one. Owners Shauna Connors and her husband Travis have even had to relinquish their no pets on the sofa rule, as their pup rules the roost. As well as flopping on humans and furniture, the friendly giant also enjoys sprawling across his fellow canines. But his tactile nature got him booted out of puppy school as he was squashing smaller dogs during playtime. Franklyn was turfed from his training group after trampling on his classmates, clearly unaware of his ""bear-like"" stature. Shauna, 41, explained: ""He has no idea how big he is. He thinks of himself as a small lapdog. ""It's hard to say no when he wants to cuddle. It's difficult to stop him because there's room for him to climb up there. ""I'm worried my sofa's going to buckle, because he's really heavy. ""With previous dogs we'd never let them on the furniture, but he's very determined and stubborn so he does what he wants. ""He got kicked out of puppy class because he was bigger than the other dogs and he'd sit on them during playtime. ""Even taking him on walks in the neighbourhood he wants to play with small dogs but he's too big for them and they'd go flying. ""He'd squash them."" The couple, from Nova Scotia, Canada , certainly have their hands full with the larger-than-life pup, although Shauna admits she ""knew what she was signing up for."" Footage of Franklyn scaling the sofa to stretch across Travis' lap for a snuggle quickly went viral as social media users were stunned by his sheer size. The enormous dog lifts his rear paws up to stand on the dad's stomach, despite him wailing in pain as he crawls across him. After finally finding a comfortable spot, Franklyn then flopped onto his chest while adorably looking at the camera. But Shauna warned not to be fooled by his puppy dog eyes - as they disguise his ""bull in a china shop attitude"". Franklyn smashes glasses, rearranges the furniture and ferociously shakes the dining table in search of scraps or his favourite toys. Yet she can't stay mad at her ""clumsy"" boy - especially as he towers over her at a tremendous six-foot when standing on his hind legs. His incredible height invites another host of problems, such as how the parents and their teen daughters Alice and Paige can clean his drool that he slobbers across the ceilings. Shauna continued: ""He doesn't mean to be destructive but he's so big and his tail is so fluffy we can't keep anything on the coffee table because they tend to go flying. ""Our reflexes have definitely improved over the past year to save the least...Catching glasses and things like that. ""Everyone says he would be so cuddly, cute and fun to have, but they're a lot of work. We take it day by day. ""We knew what we were signing up for, but you think you're prepared and your house is puppy-proofed but you forget he's going to be so tall and do whatever he wants."" Franklyn can even rest his head up on their kitchen counter - but doesn't swipe their food as he is more than happy with scraps. However, Shauna does fear for her furniture as her dog continues to grow rapidly, as he could end up weighing a whopping 14 stone. Their loveable ball of fur was bought from a breeder in March last year, two months after his birth in January. The mum said they wanted a Newfoundland due to their large size, as the family are all over 5ft 10in. And as Franklyn continues to grow, so does his fanbase - as he has become a social media sensation thanks to his sheer size. Shauna regularly uploads funny clips of her pooch on TikTok , showing his tendency to believe he is much smaller than he actually is. We previously told how another Newfoundland soared to six-foot tall and weighs 11 stone - but also still thinks he is a tiny lap dog. Elliott ­Richards, 46, and wife Beverley, 41, say they expect the adorable Sherman, who has a comedy ""I self-identify as a chihuahua"" bib, to add on at least another two stone.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dog-zilla-6ft-dog-big-834051385.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dog-zilla-6ft-dog-big-834051401.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dog-zilla-6ft-dog-big-834051386.jpg",My huge 6ft dog doesn’t realise his size – he got kicked out of puppy school for sitting on other pooches,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23180251/huge-dog-doesnt-realise-size-kicked-out-puppy-school/
"SHOCKING before and after footage shows how a luxury hotel was torched by the wildfires blazing through the Greek island of Rhodes. The sprawling four-star Sun Princess hotel in Kiotari turned into a blackened shell of its former glory as the fires laid waste to it over the weekend. Last week, the coastal hotel was sparkling in the sunlight and filled to the brim with holidaymakers relaxing by its pools or at the beach. It boasted a spa, three swimming pools and 214 newly revamped rooms and described itself as a hotel that: ""welcomes guests in a warm and friendly ambience, ideal for families and couples"". Today, it is a charred wasteland - burnt and distorted by the out of control wildfires that swept down from the mountains over the weekend and stormed across the island. Its haunting empty remains show melted furniture, a scorched playground, collapsed hotel roofs and hastily discarded luggage. Its guests had fled in a hurry when the sky above Kiotari filled with ash and smoke on Saturday afternoon and they began to feel the heat of the approaching blaze. The fires made it down to the hotel's beach where they destroyed its beach-side structures, sun loungers and left burnt sand in its wake. The hotel's entrance sign is charred to the extent it is unreadable. Some of the hotel's rooms survived, while masses of the public areas and buildings were destroyed in the blaze.

Contact us at: iona.cleave@the-sun.co.uk or worldnews@the-sun.co.uk In Rhodes, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels over the weekend in the largest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen. Terrified holidaymakers were forced to flee burning hotels , wade through water and sleep in makeshift camps on the floors of schools and gyms. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said up to 10,000 British tourists were stranded on the island yesterday, many of whom were facing a ""living nightmare"". Around 450 firefighters and seven planes have arrived from the EU to help tackle the dozens of fires while neighbouring Turkey sent 10 water-dropping planes and 10 helicopters to join the efforts. Mercy flights finally began to bring them home yesterday — with more expected today. A Rapid Deployment Team from the Foreign Office is on the ground as Brits head to the airport in a desperate bid to get a flight. Those lucky enough to get home on mercy flights described the rescue effort as a “free-for-all” as they landed at Gatwick . But furious holidaymakers have slammed airlines and travel firms for flying them to Rhodes in the first place. Today, tourists have also been told to evacuate Agioi Theodoroi and parts of Evia, Greece’s second-largest island, after forest fires erupted in the areas. Wildfires are also raging on the island of Corfu , while tourists have been warned of an ""extreme fire risk"" in Crete and now the Spanish island of Majorca. And in the popular Italian island of Sicily, Palermo airport was forced to close today due to fires burning dangerously close to its runways. The airport in the Sicilian capital was forced to shut until 11am local time, its operator said on Twitter , as firefighters worked to put out a major blaze. Meanwhile, tourists got off a flight to Rhodes after the pilot warned them it was a ""terrible idea"" to travel there. The plane was just about to take off from Gatwick when the easyJet captain urged the 37 British holidaymakers on board to think twice about their trip. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/900039216-dest-type-city-dist-834019764.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834018406.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834018443.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834023188.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834023117.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834054623.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/900039216-dest-type-city-dist-834019831.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/900039216-dest-type-city-dist-834019836.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834023335.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834018363.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834018546.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834018133.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834018377.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-fire-834018391.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-833896810.jpg",Inside devastated four-star Rhodes hotel torched by raging wildfires as tourists were left fleeing for their lives,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23180392/inside-devastated-four-star-rhodes-hotel-wildfires/
"FED-UP neighbours have shared the chaotic scenes after a wild party in their building. The once-peaceful Sydney block of flats saw about 10 police cars and cops using pepper spray to control a large group of people. All hell broke loose at about 4.30am on July 17 outside an Airbnb apartment in Surrey Hills. Shocking footage shows a large commotion between cops and guests, with one man in handcuffs appearing to try to headbutt a cop before being pushed to the ground. Andy Quan lives in the same building as the party flat and saw everything from his window. “When we looked up and looked out the window, we saw 10 police cars and a young woman being bundled into the police car and had no idea what had happened,” he said. “The woman that took the video just said she was petrified to have all of this commotion outside. “Somebody from quite far away, but could still hear it, said she woke up and thought because there were screams, people were being assaulted.” Mr Quan said despite the building's by-laws not allowing short-term rentals, the party flat owner kept advertising the three-bedroom unit as an ""entertainer's dream"", which sleeps 16 guests, on Airbnb and Vrbo. He added that it was not the first time there had been loud parties and issues, but it had never been this bad. Mr Quan said he was calling on Airbnb, Vrbo and the council to help shut it down after his failed attempts to contact the owner via the building’s strata management. “I’ve benefited from Airbnbs myself when I’ve travelled. I think in some circumstances they can be fantastic for travellers but in the wrong situations … people who stay in an Airbnb have no obligation whatsoever to be kind, considerate and respectful to other people in the building,” he said. “To have all the police out, it’s terrible for the neighbours, it’s terrible for the building. “I’m hoping that he will stop. That we will get this under control and it won’t be allowed to be used as an Airbnb again.” City of Sydney said it had received a complaint and the matter was being investigated. Airbnb told The Sun Online the company was investigating the matter. “We believe the communities in which we operate are as important as our hosts and guests. We are currently looking into this matter,” Airbnb Australia manager Susan Wheeldon said. “In NSW, all hosts and guests must adhere to the NSW Code of Conduct for the short-term rental accommodation industry. “The Code of Conduct establishes clear expectations of behaviour for both hosts and guests along with a process to address any complaints. “We’ve put a permanent ban on disruptive parties in Airbnb listings. And, if nuisance behaviour does occur, neighbours can get in touch with our team via our 24/7 Neighbourhood Support Line. “When repeated or severe violations of our ground rules for hosts are reported, listings may be suspended or removed. More than 12,000 Airbnb listings have been removed globally since April this year. “Everyone should be free to enjoy their home in peace, regardless of who’s staying next door.” Airbnb has apparently removed the property after being contacted by them, news.com.au reported. Vrbo responded to Mr Quan’s complaint saying there was “nothing further we can do” until they heard from local authorities, but a Vrbo spokesperson said the matter was being investigated and appropriate actions would be taken, which may include dismissal from the platform. The Sun Online has also contacted Vrbo for comment. New South Wales Police said officers first attended the property at about 3.30am following a noise complaint and the people inside were cooperative and quietened down. But cops had to return one hour later. “Due to ongoing complaints from the area, officers attached to Surry Hills and additional officers from Sydney City, Kings Cross and Eastern Suburbs Police Area Commands attended the home and were given permission from the owner to enter the unit,” a spokesman to the force said. “About 20 people were inside the unit and were directed to leave, with a number of attendees attempting to hinder police. “OC spray was deployed to disperse the crowd, who continued to resist police direction. The group eventually dispersed.” As a result, two people were arrested. A 24-year-old man was charged with assault police officer in execution of duty and hinder or resist police officer in the execution of duty. A 22-year-old woman was charged with assault police officer in execution of duty cause actual bodily harm, hinder or resist police officer in the execution of duty and armed with intent commit indictable offence.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/control-re-fed-airbnb-guests-834060078.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/control-re-fed-airbnb-guests-834060073-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/control-re-fed-airbnb-guests-834060075.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/control-re-fed-airbnb-guests-834052510.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/control-re-fed-airbnb-guests-834052511.jpg",We’re fed up with Airbnb guests ruining our peaceful neighbourhood with cops using pepper spray to control rowdy parties,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23180686/airbnb-guests-ruining-our-peaceful-neighbourhood/
"THE body of a missing farmer was found inside the belly of a huge 14ft crocodile as locals sliced it open in front of his horrified family. Addi Bangsa, 60, was discovered in the beast after a four-day search in Tawao, Malaysia , on July 23. The elderly man had been missing for four days before the Sabah Wildlife Department brought the tragic search to an end after cutting open the stomach of the massive reptile. The remains of Bangsa were found buried inside the animal's gut as the wildlife officials pulled them out and stuffed them into a plastic bag. Tawau Fire and Rescue Station chief, Jemishin Ujin, confirmed that the deceased's family members were present when the crocodile's stomach was opened early in the morning. After further examinations, results confirmed the victims identity as all the body parts were found inside the creature. Ujin stated that on the fourth day of the search for Bangsa, their team was informed that the rescue team had found a male crocodile believed to have swallowed the man. Further investigations confirmed the sighting of the animal and its involvement in the death of Bangsa. The animal was shot at about 3am on July 22, and the stomach was then split open at around 9am when the family members arrived. The gigantic reptile weighed about 126 st and measured over 14ft in length. The search operation concluded at 11am after the victim's body was recovered from the crocodile's stomach. This comes after an Aussie fisherman's remains were found inside a crocodile after he was ripped to pieces by two of the beasts in 2021. The grim discovery was made by wildlife officers in Hinchinbrook Island, Queensland. And the remains of a 14-year-old boy were pulled from inside a crocodile's belly after he was eaten alive in 2020. Ricky Ganya was last seen collecting snails on a riverbank in Kuching, Malaysia , when the croc pounced, clamped its jaws on his ankle and dragged him underwater. In 2017, a crocodile with a human corpse between its jaws swam to a riverbank in Indonesia to drop off the body as locals claimed it was summoned by a witch doctor. The 41-year-old, known as Syarifuddin, was bathing with friends when the six-and-a-half foot reptile pounced and dragged him beneath the water .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/13fe1a78-1915-49d6-8862-d24d100efcc3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2723caed-e15c-47bb-9b58-c58990adfe28.jpg",Missing farmer’s body found inside belly of huge 14ft crocodile as locals slice it open in front of his horrified family,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23182402/missing-farmers-body-found-inside-crocodile-slice-open-horrified/
"TWO British families who ran for their lives to escape from the inferno of Rhodes' wildfires have slammed British Airways for offering ""no assistance"". The Spindlers and the Combrincks, from Surrey , are furious at the UK airline for leaving them stranded and terrified and then slapping them with a £700 bill to get flights to safety. The families with three daughters aged between seven and five had been enjoying a sun-soaked week in Kiotari - one of the first resort areas the blaze ripped through on Saturday. They fled in their swim gear and only had time to grab their passports and a child's cuddly toy. This was the same state they were in hours later when they allegedly first contacted British Airways and were offered ""no assistance"". ""It’s upsetting to read in the press how BA are saying they are helping stranded families as that certainly wasn’t our experience,"" Emma Spindler, 50, told The Sun. Shaken, bruised and exhausting from a hellish journey , the mum-of-one says they phoned the airline on Sunday morning. ""They didn’t even ask how we were. At the stage we were speaking to them, we were in swimwear with our passports and nothing else, with no idea if our possessions or hotel had survived. ""We had no communication via email, text or their app so had not been provided with emergency contacts or directed how to make contact with BA, we just called their call centre."" Despite seeing BA's statements online that they had introduced a free-of-charge flexible booking policy for evacuees - the families were allegedly told they couldn't get on a flight and if they wanted to fly from elsewhere they'd have to pay up. The two families were forced to hatch a plan to get a ferry over to Turkey and fly from there. Looking back, I don't know how we did it ""There was no mention of help during our call,"" she said, and instead BA charged them £700 for the flight change. Their confrontation with the British airline came only hours after their horror escape from the inferno that threatened to burn down their hotel. Emma said: ""Around the pool on Saturday we were being covered in ash, but told there was nothing to worry about. ""By lunchtime, the sky had darkened, the sun was obscured by smoke and there was a smell of burning in the air."" The wildfires stormed towards them , the power went off and they were told to go straight to the beach. ""At that point my daughter started to cry, she was scared,"" she recalled. At the beach, she said: ""water was being handed out and we were given masks and towels that we were told to wet in the sea. ""The smoke was starting to make our eyes sting and as we had the children’s swimming goggles they put them on with wet towels around their shoulders."" A gruelling trek ensued for the families from Epsom. ""We walked and we walked, sometimes climbing over rocks in the water when the sand disappeared, whilst trying not to show the children really how worried we were by the situation. ""It was hard, hot, the girls were troopers, and just got on with it, no complaining...Our friends were taking it in turns to carry their 5 year old. ""Our feet were cut, but the smoke was following us and we had to keep moving."" A kind local offered them some shade and then a lift to an evacuation point and eventually they were sleeping in a hotel conference centre still in their swimwear. ""Once the adrenaline had stopped pumping and we were lying in bed, nursing cuts, bruises, sunburn and a broken toe, I realised how different the day could have been."" After a short rest and failing to get on a BA flight, they headed out on a ferry to Fethiye, Turkey and after many hours later they touched down in London. ""Looking back I don’t know how we did it, especially the children, but we did, we had to. ""There were lots of questions, which we didn’t have the answers to, I can only imagine what was going through their minds at the time."" Once safe at home, Emma said: ""Our holiday didn’t turn out exactly as we expected but we will never forget the kindness of the hotel staff and local people who have to rebuild their lives, homes and livelihoods after we get home."" Their kindness. she said, ""brought us to tears"". A British Airways spokesperson told The Sun: ""We’re doing everything we can to help our customers and introduced a flexible booking policy within hours of the news of evacuations on Saturday to enable customers to change their flights to come home early from Rhodes. ""This is a fast-moving situation and availability on our flights continues to fluctuate as customers amend their travel plans. ""Our teams are in touch with our customers to apologise and refund the difference in their journey."" In Rhodes, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea from 12 villages and several hotels over the weekend in the largest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen. Terrified holidaymakers were forced to flee burning hotels , wade through water and sleep in makeshift camps on the floors of schools and gyms. Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell said up to 10,000 British tourists were stranded on the island yesterday, many of whom were facing a ""living nightmare"". Around 450 firefighters and seven planes have arrived from the EU to help tackle the dozens of fires, while neighbouring Turkey sent 20 water-dropping planes and helicopters to join the efforts. Mercy flights finally began to bring them home yesterday — with more expected today. Today, tourists have also been told to evacuate Agioi Theodoroi and parts of Evia, Greece’s second-largest island, after forest fires erupted in the areas. Wildfires are also raging on the island of Corfu , while tourists have been warned of an ""extreme fire risk"" in Crete and now the Spanish island of Majorca. And in the popular Italian island of Sicily, Palermo airport was forced to close today due to fires burning dangerously close to its runways.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c8446112-deb9-4495-85f1-f0c3ba7b705f.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image0-3.jpeg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a2c68773-d0a0-4049-ba3e-aa686af21cca-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/69960b63-f320-478c-aafe-0e70d0bfb7d9-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/emma3.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image1-1.jpeg",British Airways left us stranded in Rhodes wildfire hell & made us pay £700 to change our flights to escape inferno,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23176156/british-airways-left-stranded-rhodes-wildfire-hell-flight-cost/
"THIS is the shocking moment a mass brawl erupted on a Spanish road aptly dubbed Sin Street. Footage shows drinkers smashing chairs over each other's heads and hurling glass bottles in the beach town of Sitges, Catalonia . It is understood the fight started between a bouncer and a passerby at a venue on Primer de Maig Street - one of the town's main nightlife strips - in the early hours of July 23. The street is popular with British tourists and widely dubbed ""Pecat"" - or ""Sin"" - Street. But the scrap quickly escalated into a wild brawl involving around 40 people. Dramatic footage shows drinkers battering each other with chairs, tables, glass bottles, stools, and metal bars. Mossos d'Esquadra (Catalan police) and local police officers - many of them women - can be seen desperately trying to break up the fight. But they were powerless to put a stop to it or make arrests. During the scuffle, two cops suffered dislocated joints, while another officer was left covered in cuts after being hit by a flying glass bottle. No arrests were made and no suspects have been identified, as those involved in the skirmish quickly dispersed from the scene. Paramedics who tended to some of the wounded - including the local police officer - said all the injuries they treated were minor. The Mossos d'Esquadra are now investigating the incident, which was not the only drama in Catalonia that night. Another scuffle that took place in Salou, another town popular with Brits, saw several youths attack bouncers with glass bottles outside the Kiss nightclub. The attack began when the young people tried to get into the club without paying the entry fee and the bouncers noticed and tried to turn them away. However, instead of leaving, the teenagers tried to force entry by throwing glass bottles at the bouncers, with the staff immediately retaliating. The suspects started running as soon as they spotted the police arriving on the scene. One - an 18-year-old - was arrested and taken to hospital with an injury to his face, while the others managed to escape. He is accused of resisting and disobeying an authority figure.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/moment-massive-brawl-happened-sitges-833894801.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/moment-massive-brawl-happened-sitges-833894807.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/moment-massive-brawl-happened-sitges-833894813.jpg",Shocking video shows massive brawl on Spain’s ‘Sin Street’ as drinkers batter each other with chairs & smash bottles,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23179592/brawl-spain-sin-street-smash-bottles/
"SUNBED hoggers in Benidorm are facing a tough new crackdown after a war erupted between Brits and locals over beach loungers. Spanish council chiefs have said they will get tough with repeat offenders after photos emerged of locals trying to beat Brit tourists to prime spots by setting up sunbeds in the middle of the night. Incredible pictures published yesterday showed locals grabbing the best spots by the sea before dawn, when many holidaymakers were still out partying or snoring in bed. The photos showed beach-lovers, described as Benidorm locals, setting up large umbrellas and deckchairs. Council chiefs said they are aware of the problem - and insisted police have been given powers to remove items abandoned on the sand where it is creating conflict. But they denied Spanish early risers were deliberately trying to deprive British holidaymakers of the best beach spots. Monica Gomez, Benidorm’s Councillor for Beaches and the Environment, admitted some Spaniards traditionally laid claims to the top spots by the shoreline as early as 6am - after cleaners had been around. But in her first comments on the controversy, she claimed some of those setting up before dawn were then taking an early-morning stroll along the beach before the heat kicked in, rather than heading back home or to their hotels to get back into bed or have breakfast. After being shown the photos of the so-called Benidorm beach wars, she said: “Traditionally there are people who get up very early to make sure they get a spot at the front of the beach nearest the shoreline and stay there all morning enjoying the sea. “It happens in Benidorm as well as other holiday resorts. “Here there are cases of people who put out their sun umbrellas and sun loungers after beach cleaning finishes around 6am and then go for a stroll along the beach before the sun gets too strong. “There are also people who put out their belongings at this early time of the morning and go home, and that is something that is not allowed. “By-laws mean the local police have the power to the act when items are left on the beach in this way and it leads to conflict between beachgoers. ""Police always act when required to in order to mediate and try to resolve disputes to make sure both parties can enjoy a good day out on the sand. “If it’s proved someone has abandoned their sun umbrella or sun lounger the police have the power to remove it. “Generally the items are left on the beach itself, by one of the entry points or by the lifeguard’s tower. “That means that when the person concerned goes to pick them up they can be advised this is something they shouldn’t be doing so they can be urged not to repeat it. “We always appeal to peoples’ personal responsibility so we all exercise a correct use of our beaches and enjoy them. “However if people persist in this sort of behaviour where they abandon sunbeds and umbrellas and generate conflict with other beach users, the police can sanction them for a reiteration of a practice that is not permitted.” She added: “You have to bear in mind that it’s not always easy to determine when belongings have been abandoned because there are people who take advantage of the cooler temperatures in the early morning to go for a stroll and in that case we’re not talking about an ‘abandonment’ that can be sanctioned. “People that get up this early are not doing it with the aim of deliberately depriving British holidaymakers of the best spots on the front-line of the beach, far from it. “In Spain there are people who traditionally get up very early to go to the beach, meaning others who turn up later such as other Spaniards, British tourists or people of any other nationality have to pick spots further away from the shoreline. “Fortunately the beaches in Benidorm are large and comfortable and have great amenities, meaning you don’t have to be by the shoreline to enjoy a magnificent day at the beach.” Last month a holidaymaker was described as the ""King of the Sunbed Hoggers"" after he was filmed sprinting for the sunbeds at a Spanish resort before dumping five towels down as others scrambled for a space. The rest of the holidaymakers didn't stand a chance as he skipped through the row of seats with his towels at the ready. A Brit filmed scenes described as a ""worst nightmare"" when holidaymakers in Majorca rushed to grab sun loungers for a day by the pool. While a couple of ""sunbed warriors"" were told to ""go back to bed"" after they were caught unstacking the sunbeds at a resort so they could put their towels down before anyone else. And the king of the sunbed hoggers told The Sun Online how to always bag the best loungers by the pool on holiday.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833848272-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833847720-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cover-darkness-scurry-towards-seafront-833847775-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/early-bird-catches-worm-say-833848274-1.jpg",Benidorm crackdown on sunbed hoggers after war between Brits and locals over beach loungers breaks out,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22944386/benidorm-crackdown-sunbed-hoggers-brits-locals/
"A WOMAN reportedly used a cobra to murder her boyfriend after plying him with poisoned beer so she could start a life with a new lover. Mahi Arya allegedly hired a snake charmer to kill the man in a twisted plot that was inspired by a true crime TV show. She then took off with her new boyfriend - leaving her ex Ankit Chauhan for dead - sparking a police probe in north India . Cops subsequently launched a manhunt and issued a £475 reward in a desperate attempt to bring in the alleged killers. Local reports said Mahi wanted to start a new life with lover Deep Kandpal and had been plotting the murder for two months. She allegedly worked with Kandpal and her maid, who has not been named, to carry out the elaborate scheme. Mahi is believed to have hired a snake charmer for 10,000 Indian rupee (£100) before inviting the victim to her house. The 32-year-old man was then allegedly tanked up with beer that was spiked with mixed intoxicants, The Times of India reported. The cobra then struck Ankit and bit him twice on both feet, causing him to lose consciousness. He was reportedly dragged into the back of a car parked a few roads away and left to perish. The sick attack was said to be inspired by hit TV show Crime Patrol, local media claimed. Ankit was later found dead on July 15, 2023, by a local businessman who alerted the cops and his sister, Isha. Authorities eventually located Mahi and Kandpal in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand, and arrested them on alleged murder charges. Initial investigations misdiagnosed the wounds on Ankit's feet as a case of asphyxia – a condition where body is deprived of oxygen causing unconsciousness or death. However, a post-mortem found he died from the fatal snake bites. Another warped lover allegedly murdered his girlfriend and chopped her up as part of a human sacrifice .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mahi-arya-woman-hires-deadly-834021680.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ankit-chauhan-woman-hires-deadly-834021562.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mahi-arya-deep-kandpa-arrested-834021579.jpg",Woman ‘used cobra to murder boyfriend after plying him with poisoned beer so she could start life with new lover’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23183506/woman-cobra-murder-boyfriend-plying-him-poisoned-beer/
"A STUDENT has been dubbed the ""Queen of Chaos"" after her collection of 11 mugshots went viral. Rayanna Belle Brock, 23, has been arrested multiple times over a string of various offences, from shoplifting, to making threats, to contempt of court - but now insists she has turned her life around. The Eastern Kentucky student went viral after an Instagram reel named ""mugshawtys"" featured 11 different mugshots of her - all taken in the past five years. But since then she has shown remorse for her crimes, describing how she hit ""rock bottom"" - before getting herself sober and finding God. Her criminal record dates back to March 2018, when she was arrested for shoplifting. In her most recent mugshot, Rayanna who goes by ""thequeenofchaos23"" on TikTok , can be seen smiling in an orange prison jumpsuit in 2020 after she was busted for making terroristic threats. The former student shared the photo with the caption: ""I'm hollering."" Sharing another mugshot taken in Stanford, she wrote: ""This is one of my favorites. ""I stole a car, wrecked it, and then brought it back to my dorm."" Despite becoming known over her long list of crimes, including theft and drug-related offences, the 23-year-old has made a complete change of lifestyle. In a recent social media post she thanked her friend Bernard Hoskins for ""saving"" her. She wrote in a Facebook post: ""This man took me in when I was literally at rock bottom and he honestly saved me from taking my own life. ""I had burnt about every bridge I ever had but he was still there for me. ""If it wasn’t for him I would’ve been sleeping on the streets many times but he never turned me away and always did what he could for me whether that was feeding my little a**, letting me take a shower, or just crashing at his place cause I had no where to go. I am so proud of him.

"A FAMILY told today how they fled wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes in just their swimwear — and said: “We’re lucky to be alive.” Toby Gallagher, 48, wife Louise, 41, and daughters Zara, eight, and Jasmin, six, were among hundreds of sunseekers on the beach when their nearby hotel caught alight . Days earlier they had seen smoke on the horizon but were assured they were not at risk. Then on Saturday fellow guests hurried to the beach with suitcases as flames surrounded the hotel, just out of sight up a winding track. Despite heroic efforts from staff, flames lapped at the doors to apartment blocks — but miraculously left rooms untouched. Toby, of Manchester , said: “I can’t believe how close the fire got. It wouldn’t be an understatement to say we are lucky to be alive. “We had been on the beach all day when suddenly people were wheeling their suitcases down the hill towards us.” Some 375 Brits had been staying at the four-star Princess Sun hotel, overlooking the golden sands and pristine blue sea of Kiotari. In the bar, terrified revellers left their drinks on tables in their rush to find safety. Windows were shattered, the roof covering an outdoor seated area caved in and a wedding venue was reduced to a mangled mess of twisted metal and ash. Louise said: “We didn’t grasp the severity of it until we started seeing people walking along the shoreline with their luggage. “A yellow parasailing boat pulled up at the water’s edge. The man on board yelled, ‘we have got to go, we have got to go, the fire’s here’.” Louise went on: “We were still trying not to panic because we didn’t want to scare the children. “There was a free-for-all for the boat but we decided to stay on the beach. “We were with three other families who, like us, had been at the beach all day and were also in their swimwear. “Those on board the boat abandoned their luggage on the sand. A lot of people were panicking.” The IT worker added: “Toby was in a pair of blue swimming shorts, I was wearing an orange bikini and a black playsuit and the girls had stripey blue cossies on. “We had nothing else with us. No passports, no luggage, nothing. “We evacuated with everyone else and a couple who saw us later gave Toby a T-shirt to put on and I was given a dress. “That’s all we’ve had for three days.” The family joined hundreds of poeple walking two miles in the dark to the nearby village of ­Gennadi as the raging inferno downed power lines. They remained at the roadside for a couple of hours and watched as military trucks evacuating up to 50 holidaymakers at a time sped back and forth. Finally, they were taken by bus to the Atrium hotel where they bedded down on the concrete floor along with 2,000 others. They were taken to another hotel on Sunday before clambering on another bus which took them to a hotel on the north of the island. A total of 19,000 have so far fled the Greek fires , the worst on record. Corfu has also been hit with red alert warnings for Crete and the Italian isle of Sicily . Mercy flights back to the UK continued yesterday and will resume again today with thousands of Brits still stranded. Tour operator TUI said it had cancelled all holidays until July 31. But those with holidays booked in the south eastern corner of Rhodes are likely to face heartbreak for much longer. Jet2 said it had cancelled flights to Rhodes up to and including July 30. It has operated ten flights to the UK from Rhodes, including four repatriation flights and six scheduled flights. A spokesman said: “We continue to fly aircraft to Rhodes with no customers aboard, so that we can bring our customers back to the UK on their scheduled flights, as well as any additional Jet2 customers who wish to return to the UK.” The Gallaghers — who returned to their gutted hotel yesterday to retrieve their possessions and travel documents — vowed to continue their ten-day holiday. Louise said Jet2 had offered an emergency flight home but she refused to leave the island without her wedding rings, which she had taken off after suffering a reaction to the heat. She insisted: “Jet2 said that if we did not take the emergency flight home we would have to pay for our own accommodation on the island and the flight back. “That was a price I was willing to pay for my rings. “We’ve since spoken to Jet2 and they have agreed to put us up in another hotel away from the fires, and to honour our original holiday flight home at the end of this week. “We intend to give the girls their holiday . “I’d rather go home, but they’ve been through a traumatic experience and I want to try and enjoy what time we have left on the island.” Meanwhile fears were growing of thousands more holidays being cancelled in the coming days — with Rhodes hotel bosses admitting they could be unable to open for at least a month. One said: “We can’t do anything until the fires have been extinguished. “We are drawing up lists of what has been left behind, packing them up and trying to get them back. “But our workers, here for the holiday season, have returned to Athens. “We also need to test the infrastructure — including the electricity. At the moment we have water, but not enough to clean all of our rooms. “If the infrastructure is OK we might be able to get the hotel back open in three to four weeks — that is the best case scenario.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dfrgreecefiresday300087JPG-JS834054284.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dfrgreecefiresday300021JPG-JS834018391.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dfrgreecefiresday300064JPEG-JS834023117.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dfrgreecefiresday300031JPG-JS834018406.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dfrgreecefiresday300071JPEG-JS834023088.jpg","We had to flee Rhodes wildfires in our swimwear as hotel went up in flames – we’re lucky to be alive, reveal Brit family",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23184884/fled-rhodes-wildfires-in-swimwear-brit-family/
"A defiant couple has claimed they WILL fly to Corfu despite the raging wildfires. Raymond and Julie, who were set to fly to the Greek island today, admitted they are ""a bit nervous"" but defied the risk and chose to see their trip as ""an adventure"". Hundreds of firefighters have been battling flames in Corfu after a fire erupted on the popular holiday hot spot on Sunday. The terrifying blaze sent holidaymakers fleeing, while emergency planes have been evacuating tourists. But despite the island being engulfed by flames, flights have been operating as usual. Speaking from Birmingham Airport, Raymond and Julie told Sky News they were planning to fly to the island unless the government says otherwise. Asked how they felt about travelling today, Raymond admitted he was ""pretty nervous"". He said: ""No one said we can't go. Are you in Rhodes, Corfu or Crete right now? Tell us your story. Contact the foreign desk at aliki.kraterou@the-sun.co.uk and worldnews@the-sun.co.uk ""We don't really know what the situation is. We know there's fires, but we don't know how close they are to where we're going."" The holidaymaker added he is ""a little bit"" concerned about what will happen once they land on the island, but is optimistic they will probably be fine. He said: ""I think the transport from the airport to the north will probably be the tricky bit, but once you get to the north by the sea, you'll probably be fine - it just depends where the fires are."" Julie said their holiday has not been ""ruined"", but is hoping to ""chill"" once they arrive. Raymond added: ""It's not classed as a holiday... [it's] a bit of an adventure."" Today the villages of Kalamaki and Apraos were evacuated as the blaze continued to spread for a third day. Previously, people in the areas of Santa, Megoula, Porta, Palia, Perithia,  Sinies Syki , Imerolia, Loutses and Kassiopi were urged to leave. Meanwhile, summer has continued as usual in neighbouring Albania as holidaymakers were pictured watching thick smoke billowing in the sky in Corfu while sunbathing. Others were spotted riding jet skis in the coastal town of Saranda. Multiple wildfires have erupted across Greece in the past few days, sending thousands to evacuate. The worst-hit island is Rhodes, where more than 16,000 people were evacuated by land and 3,000 by sea over the weekend in the largest evacuation effort Greece has ever seen. Devastating before and after photos reveal how a luxury hotel turned into a charred wasteland after the catastrophic blaze broke out in Kiotari. Today, tourists have also been told to evacuate Agioi Theodoroi and parts of Evia, Greece’s second-largest island while an ""extreme fire risk"" was issued for Crete .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-wild-fires-corfu-greece-833989418-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/raymondjpeg-JS834066193.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-wild-fires-corfu-greece-833890484.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-heat-battered-nation-war-834046442.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-heat-battered-nation-war-834046311.jpg",We are going to Corfu despite the wildfires – it will be an adventure & won’t ruin our summer,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23184673/going-corfu-wildfires-adventure-summer/
"A RUSSIAN fighter jet has blasted flares at a US Reaper drone in a clash over the Middle East, reports claim. The ""dangerous"" taunt from Vladimir Putin's war planes come amid a US Air Force mission to quell ISIS terrorists in Syria. The incident happened on Sunday, when an MQ-9 Reaper was conducting air reconnaissance, US officials say. Chilling footage from the clash shows a Russian SU-35 fighter jet ascending close to the unmanned aerial vehicle. It then appears to drop a barrage of flares in the direct flight path of the drone. The projectiles struck one of the propellers and badly damaged the US aircraft, it was reported. A US Air Force Central spokesman claimed the incident took place during a mission targeting ISIS thugs. The esteemed air fleet has been conducting raids in the Middle Eastern country as it seeks to kill the dangerous militants . Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich said: ""On July 23, 2023, at 12.23am a Russian fighter aircraft flew dangerously close to a US MQ-9 drone on a defeat-ISIS mission. ""It harassed the MQ-9 and deployed flares from a position directly overhead, with only a few metres of separation between aircraft. ""One of the Russian flares struck the US MQ-9, severely damaging its propeller. ""Fortunately, the MQ-9 crew was able to maintain flight and safely recover the aircraft to its home base."" It comes after another fleet of Russian planes reportedly attacked US drones twice this month in the same region. On July 5, Russian SU-35 fighter jets sent flares towards several US drones putting all aircraft involved at serious risk of crashing. Footage from the incident showed the MQ-9 Reapers making crafty manoeuvres to dodge the attacks. Grynkewich added: ""The Russian fighter’s blatant disregard for flight safety detracts from our mission to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS. ""We call upon the Russian forces in Syria to put an immediate end to this reckless, unprovoked, and unprofessional behaviour. ""Adhere to the standards expected of a professional air force, so we can resume our focus on the enduring defeat of ISIS."" The US Air Force claimed it would address the incidents but aimed to prevent any escalation of tensions in the region. Meanwhile, Russia's Air Force has repeatedly wreaked havoc in the airspace above Ukraine . In March, dramatic footage showed  the moment a Russian jet dumped fuel on a Reaper drone before crashing into it. The drone was subsequently taken down while flying over the Black Sea near Russian-occupied Crimea. It was the first time since the height of the Cold War that a US aircraft had been brought down by the Russians. The US has been sending drones over the Black Sea since the Ukraine war started but has now warned the flights could be a flashpoint with Russia. ""This incident follows a pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots while interacting with US and Allied aircraft over international airspace, including over the Black Sea,"" said the command. ""These aggressive actions by Russian aircrew are dangerous and could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation."" THE United States' Reaper drone, also known as the MQ-9, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used primarily for surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision strike missions. The drone is larger and more advanced than the Raptor/Predator drone, and has a longer range and endurance. Some of the capabilities of the Reaper drone include: Surveillance and reconnaissance The Reaper drone is equipped with a variety of sensors and cameras that allow it to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance from a distance. This makes it useful for monitoring enemy activities, identifying targets, and assessing damage after a strike. Precision strikes The Reaper drone can carry a range of weapons, including Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II bombs, and GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). This makes it a versatile tool for precision strikes on enemy positions, vehicles, and personnel. Long flight time The Reaper drone has a maximum endurance of up to 27 hours, allowing it to stay aloft for extended periods of time and cover vast areas of territory. Intelligence gathering The Reaper drone is capable of signals intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT), which allows it to intercept and analyze enemy communications and electronic emissions. Air-to-air combat In addition to its primary mission, the Reaper drone is also capable of engaging in air-to-air combat using air-to-air missiles, making it a potent tool for aerial warfare.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/67535238-3668-4f12-a23c-84e6fecd70f8.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/61b1d68f-22c9-4016-8ce4-fde8a1c451f5.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-us-accused-russian-pilots-834051050.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/twitterff.jpg",Russian fighter jet blasts US Reaper drone with flares in ‘dangerous’ sky clash over Middle East as Putin taunts West,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23184931/russian-fighter-jet-blasts-reaper-drone-middle-east/
"SIX men have been found guilty of murder over the 2016 Brussels terror attacks that left 32 people dead and more than 300 injured. Among them were Salah Abdeslam , who is already serving a life sentence for his role in the Paris attacks in 2015. Fifteen men and 17 women were killed when bombs exploded at Brussels Airport in March 2016 and then on a metro train passing through the city. The attacks, the deadliest since the end of World War 2 , were claimed by the Islamic State . Some survivors attended every day of the seven month trial and said the crimes still haunt them. The 12 jurors had been deliberating since early July. Sentencing will take place at a separate hearing - but not before September, with those convicted facing up to 30 years in prison. Abdeslam was the only survivor among the Islamic State extremists who struck Paris in November 2015 and were part of a Franco-Belgian network that went on to target Brussels four months later. After months on the run following the Paris attacks , Abdeslam was captured in Brussels on March 18, 2016, and his arrest may have prompted other members of the IS cell to rush ahead with attack plans on the Belgian capital. Also convicted of terrorist murder at the trial in Brussels was Mohamed Abrini , childhood friend of Abdeslam and a Brussels native who walked away from Zaventem airport after his explosives failed to detonate. Oussama Atar , who has been identified as a possible organizer of the deadly attacks on both Paris and Brussels, was convicted of terrorist murder in absentia. He is believed to have died in the Islamic State group’s final months of fighting in Iraq and Syria . In 2022, a young Belgian woman, who had been in the airport at the time of the attack, decided to be euthanised because of the “intolerable psychological” strain it had placed on her life.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jef-versele-pa-wire-note-222548859.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/40ef2d0e-9fca-4607-a797-4915adc1e59c.jpg",Six men found guilty of murder over 2016 Brussels terror attacks that left 32 people dead and over 300 injured,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23185599/six-men-guilty-murder-brussels-terror-attacks/
"NORTH Korea rolled out the red carpet for the Russian defence minister as Moscow cosies up to Kim Jong-un in a bid to get weapons. Vladimir Putin 's crony Sergei Shoigu wore his army general's uniform as he was greeted by hundreds of KPA soldiers at the start of a three-day visit to the hermit nation. The Russian national anthem rang out in Pyongyang as Kim Jong-un 's loyal troopers stood by signs welcoming Moscow 's war commander, 68. Kim then flexed North Korea 's military muscle by staging a parade showcasing his latest arsenal. Shoigu's visit comes amid the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Korean War armistice, marked as Victory Day, on July 27, 1953. But it is feared the key purpose of his visit is to boost the supply of artillery shells for his forces in Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine . The Moscow Times reports North Korea is selling artillery shells to Russia and building up its nuclear capability. Pyongyang appears to be deepening its ties with Beijing and Moscow, finding common ground in their rivalries with Washington and the West. Washington has accused North Korea of supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine. Park Won-gon, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the fact that Russia's defence minister flew to Pyongyang while his country was at war is ""very significant”. The visit is the first known of a foreign delegation in North Korea since the Covid pandemic. It comes amid reports Putin is preparing for a “long war”. The tyrant has tried this week to massively swell the numbers of young men he can conscript. Putin, 70, has widened the age cohort for the compulsory draft from 18 to 30, and cracked down on exemptions and the ability to evade military service. He is set to permit regional armed military companies controlled by loyal governors, aimed at stamping out potential revolts against his regime. A close ally Col-Gen Andrey Kartapolov, a Russian MP and loyalist parliamentary defence committee chairman, told the legislature ominously: “This law was written for a big war, for general mobilisation. “And now this already smells like a big war.” He slammed MPs for looking to exempt certain groups, or make it easier to evade the draft - as the children of many politicians do. Kartapolov added: ""We all continue to look for whom we should remove from [mobilisation], who we should protect."" But he warned: “Later there will be no one to protect."" He taunted MPs “who vote for the preservation of a comfortable life for draft dodgers” by enabling them to flee abroad.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-image-released-north-koreas-834111511.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-image-released-north-koreas-834111500-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epa10768442-guard-honor-korean-peoples-834099361.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-image-released-north-koreas-834111495.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/attends-ceremony-official-meeting-russian-834099264-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/attends-ceremony-official-meeting-russian-834099369.jpg",North Korea rolls out red carpet for Putin’s defence chief as Russia begs Kim Jong-un for weapons,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23186641/north-korea-putins-defence-chief-weapons/
"THOUSANDS of luxury cars worth £100million could sink to the bottom of the North Sea after a deadly blaze ripped through a cargo ship. Rescue helicopters and boats raced to evacuate more than 20 crew members from the 18,500-tonne vessel sailing from Germany to Egypt in the early hours of Wednesday morning. One of the crew sadly died in the inferno on the Fremantle Highway and several others were injured. The incident happened about 27 kilometres north of the island of Ameland, off the coast of the Netherlands . The Dutch coastguard said the blaze was ""still raging"" - with pictures showing a huge plume of black smoke drifting over the sea from the stricken vessel. The ship was carrying 2,857 cars - 25 of them electric. One of the electric vehicles was suspected to have sparked the fire, the coastguard said. About 350 of the cars on the vessel are Mercedes-Benz vehicles - which have an average price tag of £29,000. A spokesperson for the company told The Sun: ""We are currently in close coordination with the transport service provider concerned."" Several crew members were forced to jump overboard as the huge blaze swept through the ship, the Dutch coastguard said. ""Around midnight the coastguard received a report that the Fremantle Highway is on fire,"" a spokesperson said. ""The crew tried to put out the fire themselves, but failed. ""Unfortunately one person died and several others were injured."" The 199-metre ship, which left the German port of Bremerhaven, was towed out of shipping lanes early on Wednesday, Dutch broadcaster NOS reports. Salvage vessels are now on the scene trying to put out the blaze and stop the ship from sinking. ""Currently there are a lot of vessels on scene to monitor the situation and to see how to get the fire under control,"" Lea Versteeg from the Dutch coastguard said. ""But its all depending on weather and the damage to the vessel."" Asked if it was possible the massive ship could sink, Versteeg said: ""It's a scenario we're taking into account and we're preparing for all scenarios. ""We hope that the fire will be under control or will die out and that we can get the vessel in a safe location. ""But it's all uncertain whats going to happen now."" The crew were evacuated to the nearby Dutch port of Lauwersoog. Authorities in Germany are also monitoring the situation. A spokesman for the German sea disaster command in the northern city of Cuxhaven said rescue ships were ready to help if needed.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fire-aboard-panamanian-registered-car-834206142.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2b72db31-ba73-4a07-acf9-faea3b558128.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8c60d7b9-1b09-49b6-87bd-ed2532b2e113.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SHIP-2.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5c0e3a72-96c2-4ea9-9d0a-42eae59097b0.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/43103b1c-f294-4c27-b6f9-def9aa0e7e8a.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SHIP-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d21076ed-e894-4a7d-9f45-f67513239b19.jpg",Luxury cars worth £100million face sinking to bottom of the North Sea after ‘EV battery’ sparked deadly ship blaze,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23186769/one-dead-massive-inferno-cargo-ship-cars-north-sea/
"SWIMMERS had to sprint out of the water after two sharks were spotted stalking the shoreline of a Spanish beach. Lifeguards ordered people to get out of the water after noticing the prowling predators advancing towards the Port de la Selva beach. Holidaymakers in the water are said to have alerted attendants to the danger on the coast of Catalonia shortly before 6pm on Monday. The red flag was hastily raised to instruct swimmers to escape the water as two blue sharks approached the sand. Beachgoers are said to have begun filming the terrifying spectacle as others rushed away in fear. Civil Protection agents then headed out to try and locate the pair but were unable to track them down, so presumed they had fled. Leisure activities then resumed at the beach beloved by tourists around half an hour later - only for the sharks to return. Although the waters had been deemed safe for swimmers , a surfer came up close and personal with the creatures nearby. The sharks were lurking in the depths near the Punta s'Arenella Lighthouse, inciting further panic on the beach. Officials again headed back out on the water to find them but were unsuccessful, according to local news reports. Blue sharks have been listed as ""near threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The species, also known as Prionace glauca, can grow up to 13 feet in length and can weigh as much as 450lb. Locals and holidaymakers were warned to be wary of entering the sea following a spate of shark sightings in recent weeks. Swimmers have been on high alert throughout the summer season in Spain , as the coast has been swarmed by sea creatures. Tourists were left terrified on July 16 after noticing two fearsome fins rising above the waves just feet away off the coast of Portbou. It came after beachgoers in La Antilla thought they had spotted a shark - but the surprise guest on the shoreline turned out to be a Cuvier's beaked whale. Last month, families were seen frantically running through waist-high water as a shark swam up beside them off a Costa Blanca beach. Days later, a blue shark sparked panic at Aguamarina beach in Orihuela Costa south of Alicante. A shark was then spotted gliding through the water off a beach in Ibiza - marking the fifth sighting in Spain in just a week . Terrifying footage later emerged of another predator nearing the sands in Malaga , forcing Brits to flee to the shore. The Patalavaca beach in Mogan, Gran Canaria , was then closed after two hammerhead sharks were spotted prowling near the coast.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c6042ad0-5eaf-4666-aa23-1d0724bc92f8.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d0a1b83f-aefe-4597-ab7b-059cd4b79b56.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OP_LY_BLUE-SHARK.jpg",Two sharks spotted prowling popular Spanish beach as swimmers ordered to get out of the water,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23187057/two-sharks-spotted-prowling-popular-spanish-beach/
"DISNEY legend Randy Fullmer has died aged 73 after a long battle with cancer. The animator and producer worked on many Disney films - including The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast . Walt Disney Animation confirmed to Variety that he died on July 10 at his home in Woodland Hills in Los Angeles. Don Hahn, who worked with Fullmer, said: ""He could draw and paint beautifully, but he had the mind of an engineer, and the heart of an artisan. ""He was great at animation - great at producing movies, too. ""He was at the very centre of the Disney renaissance in animation, then when he needed a new chapter in his life, he started making exquisite and much sought-after bass guitars with that same engineer’s mind and artistic soul he brought to Disney animated movies. ""His masterful woodwork radiates with his love for the craftsman ethic of working with head, hands and heart. ""I miss him but I carry his passion and joy with me every day. Always will."" Fullmer’s family said his "" energy is now flying around the cosmos, and he would love for others to use it as inspiration to take their own creative risks"". Born in Richland, Washington on April 27, 1960, Fullmer studied film and animation at California Institute of the Arts. He launched his own animation business before joining Don Bluth Studios - creating special effects for Dragon’s Lair and Space Ace. In 1987, Fullmer was initially hired by Walt Disney Animation Studios on a three-month contract - which turned into a lengthy 18-year career with Disney. He worked as an effects animator on Oliver & Company and The Little Mermaid, a visual effects supervisor on Beauty and the Beast, and an artistic coordinator on The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. He was also a producer on The Emperor’s New Groove and Chicken Little.

"PARENTS have been warned to stay vigilant at the pool after a little girl horrifically became stuck upside down in her rubber ring. Chilling footage captured the moment the child nearly drowned when her inflatable overturned at the indoor swimming facility. She can be seen navigating the water at the pool in Guangzhou, China , joining other children and adults as a lifeguard watches on. But just seconds later, the girl begins to struggle when her bright orange float starts to tilt to one side as she sets off for a swim. The terrifying CCTV shows her being dragged underwater as her rubber ring turns completely upside down. She frantically kicks her legs in the air as she tries to fight the force of the inflatable pulling her down in the distressing clip. A torturous few seconds ensue, as the girl remains submerged underwater while trying to wriggle free from the rubber ring. The panicked youngster's splashing thankfully alerted other pool-goers as well as the on-duty lifeguard, who rushed into the water. As she fights for breath, the pool attendant quickly dives in to save her while another bloke swims over to assist. The lifeguard then thankfully helps her break free from the float before carrying her out of the indoor pool. Incredibly, it only took him eight seconds to prevent what could have been a tragedy. The pool manager, who was not named, told local media the little girl's mother and dad had left the poolside for a significant time. He said the child had ""stepped on the empty centre of gravity"" before tipping forwards into the water. The lifeguard, who was also not named, will be rewarded for his swift action. Parents were urged to keep a close eye on their kids in the water after the video highlighted the dangers of inflatables. Experts have warned that inflatable toys like rubber rings do not safely secure children the way a life vest or swim vest can. Aquatics coordinator for the American Red Cross in Long Beach Sally Schneider told the LA Times: ""They are very dangerous. ""Floating toys are the last thing you should put your child in to play in the water."" We previously told how a lifeguard warned that a popular pool accessory for kids can ""teach them to sink"" . Syrah Alyse, 21, told The US Sun that inflatable arm floaties, which she said are known to easily slip off, mermaid tales, and puddle jumpers can pose a danger to children.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-child-swimming-pool-834018857.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-child-swimming-pool-834008532.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000834008526.jpg",Warning to parents as horror video shows girl stuck UPSIDE DOWN in rubber ring in pool,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23186450/warning-parents-girl-stuck-upside-down-rubber-ring-pool/
"A FAN-FAVOURITE product is back on the shelves after customers feared it would be discontinued for good. The popular Di San Pre Wash Stain Remover was spotted by a shopper at her local Aldi store. Sophia, from Victoria, was quick to share her exciting discovery to the Aldi Fans Australia Facebook group. ""It's back! Photo taken just now at Caroline Springs Aldi in CS Square,"" she wrote. The $2.15 (£1.13) buy is a hit among shoppers across the country for its ability to remove tough stains from carpet, clothing and surfaces. The affordable product - which is only available in Australia - lifts tough stains through oxygen activation and leaves an eucalyptus scent. There is also a pink ""degreaser"" version as well as the classic purple bottle. Other customers were rejoicing over the update and flooded the comment section. ""I said to my kids, 'You know you're an adult when you're excited pre-wash is back in stock,'"" a mum joked. ""That's great news!"" another user wrote. A third added: ""I have this. Made my tops so white."" An Aldi employee also joined the conversation and explained why the product has been hard to come by in the past. ""Aldi worker here - I've been seeing a lot of posts regarding the availability of this product [and] pink vs purple,"" she said. ""Just a bit of insider info - typically the boxes are no longer a mixture of both varieties and so we may receive six boxes one day but they're all purple and the next week we receive all pink. ""Unfortunately it doesn't perfectly alternate and we may only have one colour for a number of weeks.

"OPPENHEIMER has sparked fury in India after a sacred Hindu verse was recited during a sex scene in the blockbuster film. With a cast including Cillian Murphy , Matt Damon , Emily Blunt , Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman , the biopic delves into the political and sexual intrigue around the “father of the atomic bomb”. In one scene, American scientist J Robert Oppenheimer recited a famous line from the Bhagwad Geeta after having sex with Jean Tatlock. “Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds,” he read out, a phrase the physicist reportedly recalled when the first atomic bomb he invented was detonated on July 16, 1945. However, the scene has sparked outrage from officials in India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Uday Mahurkar, an Indian journalist and senior official at the government’s Central Information Commission, labelled it ""a scathing attack on Hinduism."" In an open letter to director Christopher Nolan on Twitter , he wrote: ""As per social media reports, a scene in the movie shows a woman makes a man read Bhagwad Geeta aloud while getting over him and doing sexual intercourse. ""She is holding Bhagwad Geeta in one hand, and the other hands seems to be adjusting the position of their reproductive organs. ""The Bhagwad Geeta is one of the most revered scriptures of Hinduism. ""Geeta has been the inspiration for countless sanyasis, brahmcharis and legends who live a life of self-control and perform selfless noble deeds. ""We do not know the motivation and logic behind this unnecessary scene on life of a scientist. ""But this is a direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus, rather it amounts to waging a war on the Hindu community and almost appears to be part of a larger conspiracy by anti-Hindu forces."" ""We are living in a very polarised world,"" he continued. ""We urge, on behalf of billion Hindus and timeless tradition of lives being transformed by revered Geeta, to do all that is needed to uphold dignity of their revered book and remove this scene from your film across world. ""Should you choose to ignore this appeal it would be deemed as a deliberate assault on Indian civilisation."" Hashtags such as #BoycottOppenheimer and #RespectHinduCulture have been trending on Twitter . “This should be investigated... on an urgent basis and those involved should be severely punished,” the nationalist Save Culture Save India Foundation said. Oppenheimer was released in the United States and the UK last week and has been garnering rave reviews for its actors.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-released-universal-pictures-shows-832263950.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/florence-pugh-jean-tatlock-cillian-832286866-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/e2028d09-a7de-41f7-a59f-de2eae3dc1e0.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/matt-damon-leslie-groves-cillian-832286857.jpg",Hindu verse recited by Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer sex scene with Florence Pugh sparks fury in India,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23188291/cillian-murphy-oppenheimer-sex-scene-florence-pugh-india/
"A NEWBORN baby has been found dismembered in a rucksack, Paris cops say. The tot's mum, 21, has been arrested following the grisly discovery at her home in a suburb in the French capital. She is understood to have given birth in the commune of Stains, in the Seine-Saint-Denis area in the northern suburbs of Paris . The young woman, who lives with her parents and has not been named, told two of her friends on July 23 that she had given birth. She claimed that the child was stillborn and threatened to dismember it, according to police . Investigators believe the woman may have given birth on July 17. She was arrested for voluntary homicide on a minor under the age of 15 on Sunday, reports say. The mum was then released on Monday and hospitalised in a psychiatric facility. Doctors have described her mental state as ""fragile"". French prosecutors said that they had found the newborn baby ""dismembered, in a rucksack, in her room"". Authorities are investigating whether or not she was aware that she was pregnant and whether she was suffering from a condition called denial of pregnancy. The condition means the woman is subconsciously aware of her pregnancy, but denies its existence. Police in Paris are investigating whether the parents of the young woman were aware of their daughter's pregnancy or the suspected infanticide. The investigation is ongoing.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/unnamed-10.jpg,Newborn baby found ‘dismembered in a rucksack’ in Paris home as mother arrested,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23189269/newborn-baby-dismembered-rucksack-paris/
"THIS is the moment cops rescued six kids who were allegedly starved, battered and caged by their parents. Officers found two children - aged nine and eleven - locked in a dog cage and another four severely beaten in ""the worst"" case of child cruelty they had ever seen. They found one child with two black eyes swollen shut - with dozens of marks and bruises all over his body - at an apartment in Las Vegas . Bodycam footage released by the court showed the officers asking for bolt cutters to open the cage with the two kids inside. The video showed one of the boys hunched over and unable to walk without any help as he climbed out of the cage. Travis Doss, 31, and his wife Amanda Stamper, 33, have been charged in connection with the abuse of their seven kids - six of whom were allegedly subjected to severe physical abuse. Disturbing footage obtained by 8NewsNow revealed the horrifying conditions the children faced in the tiny one-bedroom apartment. They were allegedly locked in dog cages while a pitbull roamed freely. After rescuing the children and taking them out of the home, they told officers how they were beaten with belts, cords, and a frying pan. The child locked in the cage told cops he was forced to share meals with his siblings or eat food ""in the trash"". He also claimed his dad violently struck his face while trapped in the cage. ""He hit my face in the cage because I was squished up trying to get out of the cage because I didn’t do anything and I was freaking out,"" the child told officers in the video. According to court transcripts obtained by 8NewsNow, cops said he was locked in the cage ""all day, every day"". A nurse at the hospital where the children were taken told police that ""this is the worst case of abuse she has seen in 13 years,"" the report said. Officers discovered the abused children at the apartment during a callout on June 11. They were reportedly called after Stamper ran to a nearby Walgreens store to escape her husband, fearing for her life. She then told officers about the grim conditions in the apartment - and said one of her children ""looked dead for the last five days"". Stamper, who is currently pregnant, told 8NewsNow: ""I know they were terrified."" In an interview from prison with Las Vegas Review-Journal , she said: ""I was scared for my life and my other kids and my family."" Doss has been charged with over 40 offences - including multiple counts of child abuse and allegations of sex trafficking involving his wife. Stamper faces seven charges of child abuse for each of the kids -  including her two-year-old daughter, who is her only biological child with Doss. Both Doss and Stamper appeared in court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to the charges. Stamper's lawyer maintained that she had not physically abused the children. Prosecutors acknowledged Stamper worked as a sex worker under Doss's direction. “If she had done anything, she would’ve been subjected to serious, serious abuse,” her lawyer said in June.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4890f5b7-9cfc-4f63-b859-3c421ae1bd94.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CAGE-3.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/travis-doss-worst-case-child-834208700.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amanda-stamper-worst-case-child-834208698.jpg",‘Worst case of child cruelty ever’ as six kids ‘on brink of death’ are filmed being rescued from cages by cops,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23188354/six-kids-rescued-cages-worst-child-cruelty/
"A STATE of emergency has been declared in Rhodes as raging blazes continue to rip through the Greek holiday island. It comes as authorities have warned six new regions in Greece face ""extreme danger"" of fresh wildfires. Forest fires have swept through Greece for eight days - with the worst in Rhodes and Corfu where thousands have fled the flames. And the government today declared a state of emergency for the entirety of Rhodes. The decision comes after authorities put six of Greece 's 13 regions under ""extreme risk"" of fresh wildfires breaking out. The Civil Protection Ministry has said that some areas of Attica, Central Greece, the Peloponnese region, Western Greece, Thessaly and Central Macedonia are most at risk. This includes Viotia, Evia, Fthiotida and Fokida in Central Greece, Argolida and Corinthia in Peloponnese, Achaia in Western Greece, Larissa and Magnesia in Thessaly, and Thessaloniki in Central Macedonia. Meanwhile, officials say other areas in Crete, the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Western Greece, Thessaly, and Central Macedonia are also at very high risk of blazes. These are Arkadia, Laconia and Messinia in the Peloponnese, Etoloakarnania and Ilia in Western Greece, Karditsa and Trikala in Thessaly, and Pieria, Imathia, Pella, Kilkis, Serres Halkidiki and Mount Athos in Central Macedonia. In the last 24 hours, at least 53 fires have erupted in Greece. But fire officials assured the flames are being ""dealt with immediately"" with ""powerful ground and air forces"". It comes as the fire-ravaged country suffers another day of chaos as soaring temperatures could reach the mid-40's . Authorities have banned outdoor work between midday and 5pm. Greece's minister of labour Adonis Georgiadis said people who ignore the order will be slapped with a fine. He tweeted: ""Controls will be constant and the fines very high. ""We consider the health and safety of the workers our absolute priority. ""If the measures are followed, everything will be fine and another difficult day will pass."" The Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNNS) said Authorities have also warned holidaymakers to stay inside and use air conditioners or fans to stay cool. But there is set to be respite as the temperature is predicted to ""drop significantly"" by up to eight degrees on Thursday. It comes as... The HNNS said: ""On Thursday the temperature is predicted to drop across the country by at least 6 to 8 degrees and will not exceed 35 to 37 degrees. ""While in Thrace, eastern Macedonia and the northeastern Aegean there will be sporadic storms accompanied by very strong northerly winds."" Up to 10,000 stranded Brits are waiting for news after wildfires engulfed their hotels in Rhodes. More than 20,000 have so far fled the Greek fires , the worst on record as the inferno spread after charring swathes of land and damaging buildings. Mercy flights back to the UK continued yesterday and will resume again today with thousands of Brits still stranded. Tour operator TUI said it had cancelled all holidays until July 31. But those with holidays booked in the south eastern corner of Rhodes are likely to face heartbreak for much longer. Jet2 said it had cancelled flights to Rhodes up to and including July 30. It has operated ten flights to the UK from Rhodes, including four repatriation flights and six scheduled flights. A spokesman said: “We continue to fly aircraft to Rhodes with no customers aboard, so that we can bring our customers back to the UK on their scheduled flights, as well as any additional Jet2 customers who wish to return to the UK.” It comes after two air force pilots died when their plane clipped a tree and crashed while battling a wildfire on Tuesday. Horror footage showed the aircraft plunging into a hillside near Platanistos at the southern tip of Evia island - killing Christos Moulas, 34, and Periklis Stefanidis, 27.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/man-reacts-fire-burns-village-834078622-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-fire-burns-vegetation-834081140.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ac-crete-fire-warning-map-26-july-v2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aerial-view-shows-burnt-vehicles-834198847.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/people-look-firefighting-helicopter-filling-834111303.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-two-pilots-died-plane-834074374.jpg",Rhodes declares ‘state of emergency’ as six other Greek regions under ‘extreme wildfire risk’ while blazes rage,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23186858/greece-regions-extreme-fire-risk/
"SMOKING has been banned at another popular Spanish beach as the tough crackdown on cigarettes continues. Caló des Moro is the first "" smoke-free "" beach in San Antonio, Ibiza , meaning holidaymakers can no longer spark up on the sand. Sant Antoni City Council said they want smokers to clean up their act and stop discarding butts on the party island's famed beaches. As well as this, they hope banning smoking will improve the health of locals and holidaymakers alike. Although Caló des Moro is currently the only beach in the region forbidding tourists from having a puff, it isn't expected to be the last. The local authority plan to roll out the smoke-free scheme across beaches in San Antonio if the trial run proves a success. Hotspots in Ibiza including the Playa de Santa Eulalia de Rio and Playa de Talamanca have already banned smoking . A new law was passed in Spain last year that gives local municipalities the power to fine anyone caught lighting up on the beach . But it is up to each individual region to decide whether to impose the law - who then have the power to dish out penalties of up to £1,700. Councillor for the Environment, Pepita Torres, said she wants to ""raise awareness among citizens"" to keep beaches clean and stop sunbathers being bothered by smoke. Sant Antoni béach coordinator José Porras explained a team had been out to clear the sand of cig butts that had been dumped. He told Diario de Ibiza : ""We have collected quite a few butts this last week and we will continue all summer . ""Also, there are people who, when they see us, join us and help us. We are having a very good reception from users."" Torres went on to claim that holidaymakers have been flocking to the beach in the wake of the announcement, suggesting the public approves of the smoke-free scheme. She added: ""It is a campaign that comes from the Health and Environment Department of the Balearic Government and aims to promote tobacco-free beaches, which is why we have also decided to join the initiative."" Locals also expressed their support for the smoking ban, with many explaining their frustrations at the piles of butts littered across beaches. One man said: ""I think it is necessary. Anyone who wants to smoke should do so away from others and, above all, pick up the butts."" Another added: ""I would like to believe that people will comply, because the future belongs to everyone. ""I have a six-year-old boy and I always instill in him that you shouldn't leave garbage on the beach."" And a third resident chimed in: ""I think they should place more emphasis on cleanliness, especially in young people, because it is their future and more should be insisted on so that they become aware of the importance of the environment."" Across Spain, holidaymakers have been warned they could be slapped with fines under strict new rules for smokers . Popular beaches such as Barcelona , Lanzarote and Tenerife have prohibited the habit - but it has now been extended to bar terraces . This is in place across the Valencia region, which includes Brit-favourite Benidorm, or the Balearic Islands. However, some tourists have been ignoring the lack of ashtrays and the repeated warning signs.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2019-archipelago-received-13-6-834215662-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NINTCHDBPICT000822206799.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paradise-turquoise-water-beach-cal-834224221.jpg",Spain holiday warning as smoking is banned at ANOTHER top beach location,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23190738/smoking-is-banned-ibiza-beach-holiday-warning/
"WILDFIRES have broken out on the Spanish holiday isle of Gran Canaria as blazes continue around Europe. Flights from the Atlantic island were put at risk as flames came within metres of antennae on a mountain top that are used by the island's air traffic control. Authorities said fires had spread rapidly across the Tejeda area of the island. Hundreds of villagers were evacuated from their homes, with multiple roads closed. Helicopters were deployed in a bid to bring blazes under control. Around 700 acres of land have been effected by flames, Canarian Weekly reports. Antonio Morales, head of the Island Council of Gran Canaria , said about 100 firefighters and nine aircraft were working to put out the blaze. But the wildfires had not reached any tourist areas and no hotels had been affected. Wildfires on the island are not uncommon, and in 2019 two large blazes devastated large areas. Cops are investigating a 29-year-old man they suspect may have started the wildfire in Tejeda. He and three colleagues were working with bush cutters in an area of dry grass when flames broke out, reports El Diario . The holiday hotspot in the Canary Islands is the latest popular destination to suffer fires, after a prolonged heatwave created tinderbox conditions across much of southern Europe. In Greece, a state of emergency has been declared for the island of Rhodes as blazes continue. Wild fires have swept through parts of Greece for eight days - with the worst in Rhodes and Corfu , where thousands have fled the flames and Brit families have been forced to abandon holidays. And authorities have today warned six new regions in Greece face ""extreme danger"" of fresh wildfires. In the last 24 hours, at least 53 new fires have sprung up in Greece. It comes as... But there is set to be some welcome respite as the high temperatures are predicted to ""drop significantly"" by up to eight degrees on Thursday. Wildfires have also hit the Italian island of Sicily and Turkish seaside resort Kemer as well as areas of Switzerland, Portugal and Malta. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/helicopter-works-extinguish-wildfire-area-834074290.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/smoke-billows-wildfire-rages-area-834061546.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wildfire-rages-area-pico-de-834065994.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wildfire-rages-area-pico-de-834076238.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/plane-works-extinguish-wildfire-area-834075036-1.jpg",Gran Canaria hit by wildfires with hundreds evacuated & flights at risk as flames threaten air traffic control radars,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23193194/gran-canaria-wildfires-flights-risk/
"A BLOKE has told how his 15-stone pooch is so huge that people think he is a cow rather than a canine. Standing on his hind legs at a tremendous six-foot tall, Diego the Great Dane towers over the average pup - and his adoring owner. Dog dad Carlos, who is originally from Brazil , explained his pet has often been mistaken for a farm animal thanks to his incredible height as well as his black and white fur. But the enormous dog still thinks he can easily slot across his owner's lap - whether they're relaxing on the sofa or riding public transport . Diego is never far from his owner's side and has become a celebrity on the tube after causing a stir on commutes from their east London home. ""Almost everyone knows him,"" Carlos told MyLondon . ""If you have a Great Dane, everyone wants to come and talk and take pictures."" The animal lover explained they have been joined at the hip since he bought Diego as a puppy in 2015. Carlos spent 17 years trying to persuade his wife Ellie to become dog owners, as she was terrified of them. But the sweet talker somehow convinced her to take on one of the biggest breeds in existence - and now she is besotted with him. Carlos joked: ""Now, if I asked her to choose between me or Diego, Diego would stay. ""She does everything for him - he controls the house."" Weighing a whopping 15-stone, Diego is larger than life - and so is his appetite. The insatiable Great Dane can't help but swipe food from his brother Nelson's bowl, the kitchen side, and even strangers' plates. Carlos continued: ""He steals food everywhere - he's not very well-behaved with food. ""If some guys are having lunch and they blink, Diego will grab it."" If the humongous dog gets a whiff of his favourite snack, pizza, all bets are off and ""he gets crazy."" But his owners say their dog is a big friendly giant with a docile nature, even when fans of the Great Dane flock around him. The seven-year-old pooch accompanies Carlos to work, restaurants and even the pub - proving he really is a man's best friend. On sunny days, the inseparable duo even share a motorbike, with Diego adorably sitting in the sidecar. The pampered pooch even has a pair of his very own doggy goggles - dubbed doggles - to ensure he rides in style. Carlos said: ""If I touch the sidecar, he knows we're going out. If I put on my jacket or grab the helmet, he knows - it's crazy. ""Great Danes are lazy - they're lap dogs. Everywhere they go, they sit...I put him on the sidecar and he sat down, and that's it."" Carlos and Diego certainly turn heads on their travels, but the owner says the pandemonium around his pet has started to cause some problems. They have caused traffic jams and are often followed by crowds on the underground as fans desperately try and grab a snap of the dog. The pair have even been pulled over by the police for a picture, although Carlos panicked and thought they were in trouble. The Brazilian said he has started wearing a balaclava on his outings with his loveable hound, who appears to be taking on celebrity status. Carlos added: ""If you want to meet people and make friends, walk a Great Dane in London."" Diego even has his own Instagram profile as social media users also can't get enough of him - which boasts over 6,000 followers. We previously told how a six-foot Newfoundland who weighs nine-stone was booted out of puppy school for sitting on other pooches. Another 11-stone dog of the same breed is still squashing his owners - because he believes he is still a lap dog.

"A GUTSY grandad has told how he punched a shark in the face and frantically swam back to shore after it ripped his leg to pieces in a horror attack. Richard Stubbs, 77, was enjoying a day snorkelling at Salty Sea Fossils at the Yallingup Lagoon in Western Australia when the beast struck. Lurking among the seaweed below the excited group on the excursion was a 7ft shark waiting for its moment of opportunity. While Richard was swimming in the water on Saturday, the fearsome predator had selected him as its victim and began to maul his leg. The grandfather, from Dunsborough, south of Perth , felt its terrifying teeth sink into his flesh, but didn't know what was attacking him. He told 7News : ""All of a sudden something hit me and hit my leg hard, and I thought, 'What is that?' ""I was very frightened. I really didn’t know what to do. It was very instantaneous."" Refusing to let the sea creature get the better of him, Richard then decided to stage a dramatic escape - and counterattack. He managed to thump the shark to scare it away while freeing himself from its frenzied grip. The gang of snorkellers quickly rushed to his aid when they realised what had happened, helping him swim the 50m back to the safety of the shore. A tearful Richard said: ""Just thinking about it, the whole thing, the whole occasion that arose, I’m just lucky to have that support and the people around me. I love them."" He suffered a gruesome gash to his right leg as the shark had managed to take a large chunk out of his calf. The grandad was taken to hospital following the extraordinary battle with the beast, where he was treated for his injuries. It is thought that a wobbegong shark bit Richard on the leg, a species typically found in reefs and shallow coastal waters. They often stalk the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, particularly around Australia and Indonesia, but are not considered deadly. A shark alert was put in place in the area following the attack. Just two days later, another Aussie experienced an eerily similar ordeal in the ocean after his leg was savaged by a great white shark . The surfer, in his 20s, incredibly ""saved his own life"" and swam 600m back to shore after wrestling with the creature at Gnarabup Beach. He had been riding the waves in the Margaret River region on Monday morning when he was ambushed by the shark. The terrifying moment the surfer was attacked was caught on camera. The incident marks the seventh shark attack on beaches across Western Australia this year. Western Australia's Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development is investigating the attack. Officials have urged swimmers to take extra care around the Gnarabup and Prevelly areas due to the presence of sharks. They are continuing to monitor activity in the region's coastal waters and asked locals to report any sightings to the Water Police on 9442 8600. In February, a teenage girl was mauled to death by a shark after she jumped off her jet ski to swim with a pod of dolphins. Stella Berry had been enjoying a day on Swan River with her pals when she was attacked by what was thought to be a bull shark. A swimmer was then dragged underwater and killed by a shark in front of dozens of fishermen and beachgoers over a week later. The tragedy at Little Bay Beach near Malabar, the first deadly attack in nearly 60 years near Sydney, left witnesses vomiting and shaking . In April, an 11-year-old boy was mauled by a shark while snorkelling just a few metres from the shore in the Shire of Exmouth. A surfer, 46, then passed away after being ambushed by a shark at a popular beach near Elliston in May.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/grandfather-richard-stubbs-punched-two-834247387.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/grandfather-richard-stubbs-punched-two-834247447.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5688134c-b017-490a-8977-abc3400f54be.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/grandfather-richard-stubbs-punched-two-834247477.jpg",I punched a shark in the face after it ripped my leg to pieces in horror attack then swam for my life to the shore,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23195125/grandad-punched-shark-in-face-bit-leg-australia/
"A MAN has told how he lived a rent-free life after building an unusual home inside a sewer. Carlos, 48, who moved to the US when he was 21, was forced to think outside the box when he found himself homeless in New York . He headed to the city’s Freedom Tunnel – a railroad tunnel on the West side of the city - where he set up home and lived for more than two years. Carlos and his neighbours are known as the ""mole people"" - a name given to the homeless who live in the tunnels beneath New York. But Cuba-born Carlos insisted he had everything he needed in his underground home - including a computer, fridge and microwave. YouTube creator Erik K Swanson travelled to Manhattan to meet with people who lived underground - and Carlos opened up about living in the space. He told Erik: ""I live in the tunnel. I’ve got everything that I need, you know? I’ve got my place, everything is ok – heat, everything, electricity."" Carlos led the camera team down a stretch of unused railway track and through a hole in the ground using a ladder into his home. He showed how he transformed the sewer – even putting down a ""welcome"" doormat down and telling guests to take their shoes off. The compact room was complete with a computer, printer, fridge and microwave – all fully functional after tapping into a power source and running an electricity line into the tunnel. And Carlos said he managed to source everything from the bins. ""Everything is from the garbage – I found it. And it doesn’t smell bad here,"" he said. Carlos wasn’t the only one making a life in the sewers. He said his pal Brian had discovered the space more than five years ago and lived next door to him in another sewer. Carlos revealed that he and the rest of the tunnel community had no trouble finding food, as they’d found ways to eat for free. “Supermarkets throw out food – the food that the date has expired and some food that is damaged,"" he said. ""It is in good shape, so we take it. For food, I don’t have to worry."" But getting water into his home was an arduous task. He would have to get it from a pump, fill up some cartons and then transport them down into the sewer. Despite some of the challenges he come up against, Carlos - who has since moved on from his bizarre underground home - said living in a tunnel had huge advantages. And he said it was better than being on the streets of New York.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fdfdsfdssgfshgfhgf.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TUNNEL-11.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TUNNEL-8.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TUNNEL-4.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/people-call-us-the-mole-832748578.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TUNNEL-10.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TUNNEL-17.png",We’re called ‘Mole People’ because we live in the SEWER but we’ve got a computer and microwave – and live rent free,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23108863/i-live-in-a-sewer-in-a-tunnel/
"AN EVIL mother who smothered her three children told cops she killed one of her twins first because she was ""badly behaved"", a court has heard. Lauren Anne Dickason, 42, was charged with murdering her daughters Liane, aged six, and twins Maya and Karla, aged two. Dickason, who is on trial in the High Court in Christchurch, New Zealand , has admitted to killing her children but denies it was murder. Her defence claims she is not guilty by reason of insanity. ""I did the twins first... The first one was being really, really, really horrible to me lately,"" the mum explained, referring to Karla. ""She has been biting me and hitting me and scratching me and throwing tantrums 24 hours a day - and I just don't know how to manage that. That is why I did her first."" The sisters were found dead at their home in Timaru on New Zealand's South Island on September 16, 2021, by their father Graham Dickason. The surgeon had moved with his wife and daughters from Pretoria, South Africa, to start a new life just days before. On the night of the alleged triple murder, the 42-year-old smothered the girls 20 minutes after her husband left for a work function. On Tuesday, the jury watched a video of Dickason’s interview with police the day after the girls died. The recording showed the mother saying she had not ""felt normal"" for months before ""something just snapped"", the New Zealand Herald reported. During the interview, she talked about the ""overwhelming"" move from South Africa to New Zealand and said how she had lost hope. ""I don't even know where to start... It just got too overwhelming - and with the new visa thing that came through yesterday I just see no hope for us here in the future,"" Dickason told cops. ""Just getting on the aeroplane was enough of an effort, there was so much paperwork to be done and then there was the two weeks in MIQ which almost had us crazy. ""Something just snapped last night."" She explained that the children were jumping on couches and not listening to her. So she went to the garage, spotted some cable ties and thought, ""That could possibly work"". In the interview, Dickason admitted she ""had been thinking about it for sure,"" and put the three sisters in a room before using the cable ties on them. That attempt was unsuccessful, however, so she suffocated them. Detectives then heard that Dickason tucked each child into their beds, pulling the blankets over their heads fully aware that they were dead. She said: ""Then I decided I had to do something with myself… and I ran through the house and none of the knives were sharp and then I just started drinking my medication that I could find. I wanted to die."" Dickason explained that in the lead-up to the alleged triple murder, she had been getting only two hours of sleep a night, was losing many kilos due to stress and had not felt normal for around nine or 10 weeks before. She went on to say that moving to New Zealand had only exacerbated issues. The mother added that it was her ""first day off"" in four months, telling officers that after killing the girls she just climbed into bed with a hot water bottle and processed everything that had happened. In the interview, Dickason explained that she been diagnosed with major depressive disorder in 2015, had post-natal depression after the birth of each daughter and was being medicated for years before stopping in early 2021. She also admitted to having thoughts of harming her kids in the past and had told her husband on three occasions that she was scared as she had considered hurting their children. The mother sat with her head in her hands as the interview recording was played in court. Earlier in the trial, the jury heard Dickason had carried out several searches regarding how to overdose children and what the lethal or fatal qualities of specific drugs were. Last week, Crown Prosecutor Andrew McRae alleged Dickason was an angry and frustrated woman, who resented her daughters for standing in the way of her relationship with her husband. Mr McRae alleged the mother was fully aware of her actions and labelled the killings as methodical, purposeful and perhaps clinical. The defence, however, argued that Dickason was ""very unwell"" and didn't recognise how unwell she was until it was ""too late"". The trial will resume on Wednesday and is expected to run for at least another two weeks. Experts are also expected to speak on whether they believe the mother was insane.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pure-evil-evil-mum-s-834258631.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/graham-lauren-dickason-three-children-680419061.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/graham-lauren-dickason-three-children-680387142.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pure-evil-evil-mum-s-834257896.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/graham-lauren-dickason-three-children-680629940.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/graham-lauren-dickason-three-children-680419065.jpg",Evil mum’s ‘horrifying reason for killing one of her twins first before murdering her other two children’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23196014/evil-mums-reason-killing-twins-murdering-other-two-children/
"A BRITISH woman has killed one person and left another seriously injured after smashing her car into a Costa Blanca petrol station in a Mercedes. The horror smash happened around 5pm local time this afternoon at the filling station near the small town of Benitachell a 30-minute drive north of Benidorm. The driver believed to be 48 years old, was left unharmed after smashing into the front of the petrol station shop. She then crossed through the premises at speed before exiting the other side, local reports say. It is not clear if she lived in the area or was on holiday and whether she has been formally arrested. A witness said the driver had entered the petrol station “at speed” although this has not yet been confirmed by police . The person who died, an 84-year-old Spanish man, is thought to have been paying for petrol. The other casualty , a woman who suffered injuries which included a broken leg, has also been described locally as a customer. Police have not yet revealed whether the Brit driver tested positive for drink or drugs in tests routinely performed on drivers after road traffic incidents. Benitachell has become a popular place for expats to reside as it is close to popular Costa Blanca resorts like Javea or neighbouring Moraira and property is cheaper than on the coast a short drive away. An investigation into the incident was underway by the Civil Guard. The horror crash happened at a BP petrol station on the road from Benitachell to Javea. Earlier this month a British teenager died while on holiday after being crushed by his overturned quad bike. The bike is thought to have deviated from the road in Zakynthos , fatally injuring the 19-year-old.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/filling-station-near-small-inland-834279619.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/filling-station-near-small-inland-834279718.jpg",Brit smashes Mercedes into a Costa Blanca petrol station  leaving one customer dead and another injured,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23183905/british-killed-one-crash-costa-blanca-petrol-station/
"THIS is the dramatic moment a British-made Starstreak missile annihilated a Russian helicopter. One of Vladimir Putin's top commanders onboard the Ka-52 was killed when the aircraft plummeted in Ukraine , defence sources claimed. Gripping footage showed the downing of the Russian war chopper after it was directly struck by the surface-to-air missile. The Ka-52 Alligator was seen engulfed in flames and descending rapidly through a thick plume of smoke after it was blasted. The helicopter then smashed into the ground and exploded as flames appeared to rage into the sky. According to Moscow defence sources, the rockets were reportedly fired from a Stormer light tank donated last year after Putin’s invasion. A picture released by Ukraine’s Marines confirmed the strike and showed the wreckage on the ground in frontline eastern Donbas . The deadly Ka-52 Alligator was hit near Donetsk by Ukraine’s 38th Marines, Kyiv said. A senior Russian commander was lost in the strike along with another officer, it was reported. His name and rank has not yet been disclosed. Russian pro-war blogger Kirill Fyodorov claimed the commander was in the cockpit at the time of the strike. He wrote: ""As a result of the strike by three British SAM Stormer missiles, a Ka-52 was shot down. ""We have lost heroes."" The Starstreak high velocity missiles can hit objects the size of a tennis ball at three times the speed of sound. It splits into three warhead darts in mid-air to increase the chance of collision. It comes as Western officials said Russian troops were thinly stretched by Ukraine’s counter offensive.

"HOLIDAY hotel swimming pools are being drained by fire crews — some using helicopters — in a desperate bid to find water to fight wildfires. Power failures due to downed electricity lines mean mains pressure has dropped, forcing emergency crews to take drastic action in a “race against time” to save parts of Greek island Rhodes . A chopper was seen drawing water from one of three pools at beachfront hotel Ampelia Seaside Resort in Gennadi yesterday to tackle the wildfires raging across nearby hillsides . And firefighters from Slovakia — who answered the island’s plea for help — jumped into another of the hotel’s pools to hook up pumps to fill tankers, which were driven to the fire’s front lines. Crews working round the clock told The Sun how high demand for water from residents and tourists on the island amid record-breaking 41C temperatures, has added to the serious shortage. It comes after a state of emergency was declared across the entire island, with 53 separate fires raging . One firefighter said: “There are 600,000 litres of water in these three pools. We are pumping 600 litres of water out per minute. “This is now critical. The electricity outages mean we don’t have enough water pressure on the island to be able to fight the fires. “This is a tiny island and it still has lots of tourists and locals — think about how many gallons of water they are using. There is not enough.” Mercy flights continued to bring stranded British tourists home yesterday. Last night, UK travel bosses called for a change in the Foreign Office ’s advice for holidaymakers heading to Rhodes . Which? travel editor Rory Boland said: “Without a Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office warning against travel to the affected regions, travellers who don’t want to go but are refused flexibility to rebook are likely to be left holding the bill for acting sensibly, and will be unable to claim on insurance .” He urged those due to visit the island in the coming weeks not to cancel yet, as they may not get a refund. Greek holiday spots Crete, the Peloponnese and Ionian Islands, western Greece, Thessaly, and central Macedonia are also at high risk of blazes.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wild-fires-rhodes-greece-slovakian-834244851.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hotel-pool-fire-service-helicopter-834260148.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/race-time-hovered-ampelia-seaside-834254247.png",Hotel swimming pools in fire-ravaged Rhodes drained by choppers in ‘race against time’ to tackle raging infernos,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23199593/rhodes-hotel-swimming-pools-drained-wildfires/
"A BRITISH rapper once believed to be the ISIS killer ""Jihadi John"" has been found dead in his prison cell in Spain. Former London schoolboy Abdel-Majed Abdel Barry, 32, was in jail awaiting a verdict on terror charges . His body was discovered by guards at El Puerto III prison in Cadiz on Wednesday morning . He had been tried earlier this month at a court in Madrid accused of leading an roaming jihadist cell he allegedly formed after leaving Syria, and was awaiting the verdict. Abdel Barry was arrested with two men described as aides less than a week after they were smuggled onto a beach on Spain’s southeast coastline in April 2020. The Egyptian-born suspect - who grew up in West London - was stripped of his British citizenship after allegedly joining ISIS . He was charged after a long-running investigation sparked by his arrest at a hideaway rented flat in Almeria. Investigating judge Maria Tardon said in a formal decision to charge him that he had been smuggled into Spain by boat with two Algerian men less than a week before he was located and held. He was warned before his trial at Madrid’s Audiencia Nacional court , which finished on July 14, he could face nine years in prison if convicted. On the opening day of his trial, he denied all terrorism charges against him, insisting he had never been in the Syrian city of Raqqa before claiming he went to the country for humanitarian reasons. He also denied being pictured holding a decapitated head in Raqqa in 2014 after sickening images emerged on social media with the caption:  “Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him”. Prosecutors said in a pre-trial indictment that the former British national used bitcoin to buy stolen or cloned bank cards on the Dark Web. An internal Spanish Prison service investigation will now take place and his family will be given the right to hold their own autopsy aside from the official post-mortem to establish the cause of death. A separate probe will be carried out by a court in the town of El Puerto de Santa Maria. Abdel Bary claimed to be a Syrian national called Ahmed Mohamed Al Oulabi when he was held in Almeria in April 2020. Reports at the time said he was arrested after police spotters identified him by his ears when he opened a second-floor door to receive a kebab takeaway from an Uber Eats deliveryman. Previously, Abdel Bary had emerged as a key suspect in the hunt for the man dubbed Jihadi John, who was filmed beheading Western hostages. The ISIS executioner was subsequently named as fellow Londoner Mohammed Emwazi in February 2015. Abdel Bary was also wrongly identified as a possible member of ""The Beatles"", four ISIS terrorists with British accents who tortured and beheaded foreign hostages in Syria. He moved to London from Egypt as a six-year-old after his father was released from prison. Dad Adel Abdel Bary was suspected of being involved in al-Qaeda bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and was extradited to America in 2012. Before becoming radicalised and leaving Britain, Abdel Bary made a name for himself as a rapper and had some of his music played on Radio 1. In 2013, he walked out of his family home saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah”. One Spanish report has suggested Abdel Bary was intending to return to the UK when the coronavirus lockdown was over. But respected Almeria-based daily Ideal reported at the time of his arrest that he picked Almeria as a Plan B hideout after the onset of the Covid-19 crisis and lockdown scuppered his initial plans to reach Catalonia. A Spanish National Police spokesman said at the time of Abdel Bary’s detention: “National Police officers have developed a counter-terrorism operation which has culminated in the arrest in Almeria of one of the most wanted Daesh Foreign Terrorist Fighters in Europe. “Another two people have been arrested and the authorities are currently working to establish their identity and their relationship with the other man.” As well as membership of a criminal organisation he was also charged with fraud.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-suspected-islamic-state-fighter-831545806.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nb-copyright-unknown-collection-pictures-118936090.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-l-jinny-accused-allegedly-831237214.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-islamic-state-fighter-abdel-578659716.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rapper-abdel-majed-abdel-barry-122152779.jpg","Brit rapper-turned Jihadi, 32, found dead in Spain prison cell while awaiting a verdict on terror charges",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23199305/brit-rapper-terrorist-dead-spain-prison-cell/
"RUSSIAN warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin abused “barely legal” girls and believed sex with virgins kept him young, it was reported yesterday.

He is said to call virgins “shampoo” because, like the disposable hotel freebies, “you use them then toss them away”. One, called Masha, claimed she sold her virginity to him when she was 18 in 2019 for £482. She said he was a flop in bed as his “tiny” manhood was enhanced by implants. She said: “It seems like there were always rooms reserved for him and the girls and there were always people who supervised them. “There were girls - not virgins - whom he paid 5,000 rubles (around £60) for sex. “They were the ones who told me that it was Prigozhin. “Everything was very fast. “He just left the money in a pile on a chair.” A sex workers’ union official said: “He had sex without a condom he believed that this is how he exchanges energy, fluids. “It’s as if he receives a charge of vitality from them.” The Kremlin is trying to humiliate and discredit him since his 36-hour rebellion on June 24.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-head-wagner-group-yevgeny-834103034.jpg,Putin’s Wagner warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin ‘abused “barely legal” girls and believed in sex with virgins’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23200881/putin-wagner-prigozhin-abused-barely-legal-girls-virgins-claims/
"BRIT holidaymakers heading to Greece have been issued a warning over a new ban on popular beach activities. Greek officials have introduced a ban on nearly all water recreational activities on the idyllic islands of Koufonisia. This includes popular water sports such as water skiing , kite surfing, parasailing and using water bikes or jet skis. Only swimming will be allowed in the clear blue waters of the two islets, located in eastern Cyclades in the interest of public safety and preservation, the newspaper Kathimerini reports. The new regulation was announced by Naxos harbour master Rear Admiral Alexios Apostolopoulos amid concerns about motorised and non-motorised activity around Ano and Kato Koufonisi. The new measure has been imposed due to the islands' unique features including a small coastline that has seen increased activity from tourist boats, ships and other vessels. Authorities deem that the use of recreational water vehicles poses a higher risk of accidents. Apostolopoulos noted: ""There has been no accident. We're just being proactive."" The decision has been made to protect cultural heritage on the islands- especially since Kato Koufonisi has been declared a protected A Zone area. Alexopoulos had previously banned any fishing activity, and anchoring of motorised marine recreational vehicles in the tourist-filled beaches of Naxos, in a bid to protect swimmers and the marine ecosystem. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Italy , holidaymakers were warned after a foreign seaside resort clamped down on tourists due to overcrowding. An odd new rule has now been put in place to control traffic during the busiest season of the year in popular hotspots Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast. A similar rule has been introduced in Spain, where officials in Barcelona are placing the restriction for both tourists and locals at the Bunkers del Carmel after it become too crowded and trashed by partygoers. While a new smoking ban is in place on some of Spain's most popular beaches.

"HOLIDAYMAKERS heading to Spain are being warned over a beach rule after a tourist was slapped with a £85 fine. The oblivious beach-goer was hit with a fine after he was spotted being naked in Playa de Palma in Majorca . The man was in the nude at the beach on Monday afternoon around 4pm when Spanish cops informed him he was breaking an important beach rule. He was told he was in breach of Palma town hall ordinance in respect of the use of public space, Majorca Bulletin reports. Fines can range from  £85 (€100) to £640 (€750) depending on the case. The tourist's rule-breaking was considered minor so he was fined £85 (€100). It was reduced to £69 (€80) as it was paid on the spot. But for those who prefer nudism, Spain has the largest nudist beach in the world - and it even has naturist bars and hotel. Vera, on the Almeria coast, is one of the few places you can swim all year round without having a stitch on. Meanwhile, tourists on Spanish beaches could also face fines if they join the so-called sunbed wars . The local council in Benidorm says it is fed up with sunbathers flocking to the beach as early as 7am to grab the best seats.

Jill Banstone stumbled across the harrowing scene near the Glenelg Jetty in Adelaide while strolling across the beach early this morning. She found the body of a 61-year-old man face down in the shallow water while out with her pet labrador at around 6.50am. Jill said she had noticed something unusual floating in the sea and immediately alerted emergency services. The local told 7News : ""I realised when I got closer it wasn't a rock. He was face down."" Police then faced a race against time to recover the victim's body before the tide came in. He was dragged out of the water by cops before paramedics tried in vain to resuscitate him on the shoreline. Investigators said there were no signs of violence on his body and the death is not being treated as suspicious. ""It is early in the investigation however the man’s death is not believed to be suspicious,"" the force said. Crime scene investigators remained at the beach which is frequented by locals and tourists. According to local news, the man had been reported missing by loved ones at around 9pm on Wednesday night. He is said to have a history of mental health issues. No further information regarding the victim or his identity have been released. Police will prepare a report for the coroner.

Shocking footage shows the beast charge at Andrés Roca Rey , 26, before crushing him against the barriers and throwing him in the air. Renowned Peruvian bullfighter Roca Rey was rushed to hospital with multiple injuries following the terrifying incident at Spain 's Santiago de Santander Fair. The clip shows Roca Rey holding up a cape to the massive bull, named Viruta. After taking a couple of steps towards the horned beast, it then starts hurtling towards him - running straight into him. The mighty bull then tosses Roca Rey in the air before slamming him against the barrier as other men frantically rush over to help. But the bull then gores another bullfighter - Cayetano Rivera Ordoñez. Roca Rey was left with injuries to his neck, face, right thigh and left knee - the worst of his eight-year career. The incident on Tuesday comes just weeks after he was rammed by another bull. Roca Rey is understood to be recovering at his home in Seville and is set to undergo further tests, reports Levante . According to the outlet, he already has his sights set on appearing in Huelva in August 3. Last year Roca Rey shunned doctor's advice after being gored in Bilbao and carried on the contest. And in 2017, a bull’s horn left a four-inch hole in his left inner thigh. He was also famously gored five times in his first five fights and has become a viral video sensation - but amazingly refuses to give up the controversial sport. Roca Rey's catalogue of injuries includes being battered unconscious and suffering amnesia, being gored in the buttock and groin, having two teeth knocked out when a bull stabbed him in the mouth, concussion and a shattered right cheekbone. Bullfighting critic Antonio Lorca told The Telegraph: ""He is like the Messi or Ronaldo of the bullfighting world. ""No one has such acclaim as him or can fill bullrings wherever he fights.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2aa83509-0066-434c-b3f2-ebb5f79501c8.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bull2.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bull4.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/peruvian-bullfighter-andres-roca-rey-831096887.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epa05518993-peruvian-bullfighter-andres-roca-263513378.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/peruvian-matador-andres-roca-rey-260607807.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/peruvian-matador-andres-roca-rey-338167003.jpg","Moment bullfighter dubbed the ‘Messi of Matadors’ is gored by 1,000lb bull after being slammed against barrier by beast",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23202504/bullfighter-gored-bull-slammed-barrier/
"A BRIT dad has died after mysteriously falling from the second floor balcony of his holiday home in Bulgaria. Paul Bond, 61, passed away in a local Bulgarian hospital on July 23 after suffering with severe head injuries. The devastated family had set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds to airlift him back home to Bristol for treatment but he was soon put into a coma. The donation page was widely shared online but Bond sadly died while still in Bulgaria. Earlier this week, his daughter Abi Bond, shared the tragic news of his death on social media . She said: “Dad passed away on Sunday afternoon. We just want to thank everyone for your kind words, prayers, support and donations, we will be forever grateful. We will be getting Dad home as soon as possible.” Bond, who was described as “a hugely loved father, grandfather, son, brother and friend” had been renovating his holiday home when it appears he tumbled over the second floor balcony. He was found by a friend on the morning of July 9, although it remains unclear when exactly he had fallen. The dad was dashed to hospital in a coma due to severe brain injuries and he later underwent surgery. His daughters Abi and Sophie rushed to Bulgaria to be at his bedside after he had been placed on life support. His condition was described as stable, although he remained on life support and his head injuries were believed to be irreversible, according to the GoFundMe page. The fundraising effort raised nearly £7,000 which will be used to bring him back to home to Bristol. Family friend, Rebekah Richardson said: ""We're incredibly appreciative of all of those that have shared our story, the family story, all of those that have donated. It's amazing what people have done so far. ""I just think it's a time to pull together as a community. None of us imagine something like this happening to someone we love.

"A BENIDORM bar owner has shared his top tips for having the wildest time in the party resort - and warned holidaymakers not to believe what they see on TV. Frank The Stag Man revealed all the hidden tricks to getting the most out of your holiday after living in the city for over a decade. The self-proclaimed ""King of Benidorm"" - who once hosted 200 stag and hen dos in his bar in one day - has shared everything he's learned about having the best time out on the town. Frank explained that it's not usually the pricing of Benidorm holidays that puts people off - but the way it is portrayed on our TV screens. He believes shows such as Benidorm and Bargain Loving Brits display the city as ""really boring"" and only shows ""about five per cent of what Benidorm's really like"". ""Benidorm is cheap and cheerful, it's not an expensive place,"" he told The Sun. ""It's such an amazing, exciting place."" Frank bought the popular Miller's Bar shortly after moving to the party resort from Gran Canaria 11 years ago - dubbed the home of ""extreme stag and hen fun"". The bar hosts some of the wildest nights on the island - where Frank looks after stags being covered in hot wax and stripped on his tables. ""It's just one of those things where what we've created over the years has just really kicked off so that it just became bulletproof,"" he said. ""I always pushed the boundaries as much as I could. You know, like try and go more extreme because that's what the people want. ""Having a bar or having bars means two things. Number one, you have to run them, and number two, you have to make 'em busy. ""And I was very good at making them busy. The bar works really well, but it is famous for being a stag and hen super bar. ""I think that's where we say what happens in Benidorm stays in Benidorm. Right?"" But while running Miller's, Frank has witnessed the common mistakes that visitors tend to make while on holiday that can turn your glam getaway into a total nightmare . ""Cash is king in Benidorm, places do accept card but some don't,"" he warned. ""We have a lot of experiences with people that have cards, and then because they're overseas, their card is blocked by their bank ."" The bar owner recalled seeing several boozed-up guests trying to get money out of machines but their card being declined - and said it's becoming an increasing problem in the city. ""They're over on a weekend and the banks are not open, so they've got a card and they can't use it,"" he said. ""When you go somewhere on holiday and you stick your card in a wall or you go to pay for a drink and suddenly your card is blocked and you can't get hold of the bank until Monday, that's a real problem. ""A lot of the time the hotels want deposits. How are you going to pay your deposit if your card is blocked and you haven't got any cash?"" But this isn't the only thing standing in the way of you enjoying a wild time in Benidorm, according to the party expert. Frank also urges tourists to take a picture of their hotel so they don't get lost on their way home from a night out - especially if they're taking a taxi. If you're planning a trip to the party island, you may be wondering where the best places are to visit if you're looking for an ""extreme and memorable stay"". The ""Stag Man"" told The Sun that Benidorm is made up of three main areas - Old Town, New Town and Rincon. He recommends the Old Town to families and holidaymakers looking for a more traditional and relaxed visit to the island. Meanwhile, New Town - a large area that Frank has called ""Clubbing Land"" - is home to the famous English Square. ""You've got really good Irish bars, Scottish bars, you've got Northern Island bars, you've got Welsh bars,"" Frank said. ""It's very cosmopolitan, there's something for everyone there."" Also based in New Town is The Strip - which is massively popular with party groups because of its clubs, tribute bars and cabaret bars. Frank advised those looking for a strictly family-friendly holiday to Benidorm to visit Rincon which is filled with beaches, markets and restaurants. ""Benidorm was literally just two and a half hours away from the UK,"" he said. ""It was busy and it just appealed to me because it was a bit more like the UK but with better weather and the better climate."" It comes after we spoke to Frank's girlfriend, the legendary stag do performer Jade Benidorm who shared her top tips for surviving the party city. Together, the power couple have taken the island by storm as they team up to give visitors the most ""memorable holiday"" while becoming more widely recognised in the streets of Benidorm. ""It's a big thing to wrap my head around because it's, just so unexpected,"" she told The Sun. ""It wasn't planned, it wasn't like we tried to do this, we were just doing our thing and doing what made us happy.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c9fa5c54-6766-4665-bdcb-d02cdee880a5.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c8063690-676e-4128-9f70-88e3b5b88a22.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/15958ce7-d576-4e9c-8394-11133eb6f920.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/top-tips-best-wildest-time-834034212.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/top-tips-best-wildest-time-834034205.jpg",I’m the King of Benidorm – My top tips for having the wildest time on holiday… don’t believe what you see on TV,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23175165/king-benidorm-tips-wild-holiday-stag-dos/
"THE search for a missing schoolgirl has entered its third day and cops say they are growing concerned for her safety. Pepper Stern, 12, went missing nearly 48 hours ago from Sydney , Australia's quiet ""millionaire's row"", where its palatial houses can sell for up to $10 million. Pepper was last seen outside a business on Girilang Avenue in Vaucluse, in the city's east, at about 11.15am on Tuesday. As well as its lavish homes, the avenue is also known for its bustling commerce, but neither residents nor shop owners said they saw anything. The girl had been living at a home in a nearby street before she disappeared, but it's unclear why she was in the area during school hours. Pepper is said to be 162cm with long brown curly hair. She was last seen wearing black tracksuit pants, an orange jumper, and white joggers. Pepper is also known to frequent Glebe, in the city's inner west, police sources revealed. Cops confirmed that the 12-year-old was still missing as of 9.30am on Thursday. MPs Kellie Sloane and Allegra Spender have now joined the hunt for the student. Both shared details of the missing girl on their social media platforms as fears grow for her safety. ""I've been on the phone to local police this morning and they are still concerned for her welfare,"" said Ms Sloane. ""Please share this information so we can ensure Pepper is safe."" Neighbours and the local community also joined efforts to try and find the girl. Jewish House organisation and several rabbis have begged for the public's help on social media. A Jewish school in the eastern suburbs also posted an alert on Instagram for her, but later stressed Pepper was not one of their pupils. Anyone who sees Pepper or knows anything about her whereabouts has been urged to contact police as inquiries continue.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pepper-stern-834411109.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3c86fa47-195e-41ed-bff1-31e597eb1d92.jpg","Fears grow for missing Pepper Stern, 12, after schoolgirl vanishes from ‘millionaire’s row’",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23203623/missing-pepper-stern-12-schoolgirl-sydney/
"SIX tourists have been killed as a helicopter ""hit overhead cables"" and crashed in Siberia. The Mi-8 helicopter crashed and burst into flames in the Altai Republic after getting caught in the wires. Local media has reported: ""When approaching for landing in the village of Tyungur, Ust-Koksinsky district, the Mi-8 helicopter of Altai Avia hit electrical wires, fell and caught fire."" There were reportedly 15 people on board the helicopter, three of whom were pilots. Following the crash, three passengers are thought to be in critical condition with eight other people left injured. The Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed the crash of the helicopter, saying that firefighters are working at the scene of the emergency. The deadly crash took place in eastern Russia near the border with Mongolia . ""There are 3 crew members and 12 passengers on board, information about their condition is being specified,"" the Federal Air Transport Agency said. Emergency services dashed to the scene and reported that the burnt helicopter was destroyed. In horror footage, the chopper is engulfed in flames while black clouds of smoke billow into the sky.

"FILLED to the brim with more than 1,200 stores, this mega-mall in Dubai is heaven for shoppers. Spanning the size of around 200 pitches, it is the world's largest shopping centre - and even features a bizarre shark -infested tank. With the Burj Khalifa towering over, the 12million sq ft site is home to more than 200 food and drink outlets - the ideal respite from a long day of shopping. As well as reams of retail stores, Dubai Mall is centered around its two flagship department shops - Galeries Lafayette and Blommingdale's. And for those looking for something a little more luxurious, there are more than 70 signature stores in its dedicated Fashion Avenue. But as well as indulgent brands, the mall also houses UK high street favorites such as M&S, Boots and Waitrose. A waterfall within the building is understood to act like an optical illusion, with statues of people diving said to disappear if you stare at one of them. Hundreds of thousands of hopeful shoppers flock to the mall every week - making use of the 14,000 parking spaces. According to the mall's website, it is the ""most visited retail destination in the world"", attracting more than 100million visitors every year. And those guests can choose to be treated like VIPs with a valet service, shop and drop with delivery, an in-mall chauffeur service, and more. But aside from shops, the mall even boasts its very own aquarium with more than 140 marine species. Visitors can gawp at the incredible 270-degree walk-through tunnel as sharks, rays and fish swim by. It offers guests the opportunity to ""walk with the world's ultimate predators wearing an oxygenated helmet that allows you to breath underwater"". The mall's website boasts that ""there are over 400 sharks and rays in the tank, including the world's biggest collection of sand tiger sharks"". Last year, terrifying footage captured the moment two scuba divers came face-to-face with the world's ""creepiest"" shark as they explored the aquarium . Gripped onlookers watched as the enormous one-eyed shark with deformed gums and bizarrely-protruding teeth swam just metres away from them. Meanwhile, guests can zoom past the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, on an open-air track, or take a spin on the Olympic-size ice rink For film buffs, the mall's cinema has 22 screens and can sit an impressive 2,800 guests. Dubai Mall opened its doors in 2008 after two delays. And the shopping centre is open seven days a week - closing as late as midnight on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. In 2019, the mall grew even larger with the opening of Dubai Mall Zabeel. It is linked by an air-conditioned footbridge and has 3,000 parking spaces of its own. Meanwhile, we took a look at the world's largest office building in India's diamond capital. The Surat Diamond Bourse (SBD) has spared no expense on its sprawling new trade centre that is taking shape in the west of the country. The 15-storey complex boasts 7.1 million sq ft of floor space, knocking The Pentagon off the top spot as the globe's biggest office building. It dwarfs the United States Department of Defense headquarters which has held the title for over 80 years. But the architects behind the build say it was out of necessity rather than competition - as diamond companies snapped up all the offices before construction even began. The SDB sits on more than 35 acres of land and is billed as a one-stop shop for over 65,000 diamond professionals.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dubai-mall-united-arab-emirates-834425458.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c54y4p-louis-vuitton-store-dubai-804657052.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sharks-swimming-people-tunnel-dubai-272640906.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/uae-dubai-downtown-dubai-dubai-819608626.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/w2ccpw-united-arab-emirates-dubai-834425360-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/designer-fashion-stores-dubai-mall-819608679.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dubai-dubai-united-arab-emirates-819608542.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epx5hr-dubai-mall-interior-dubai-383634268.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pnexwh-jimmy-choo-shoes-display-777710738.jpg","Inside world’s largest shopping centre the size of 200 football pitches with shark-filled aquarium and 1,200 stores",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23203241/worlds-largest-shopping-centre-aquarium/
"A HOMEOWNER scrawled an X-rated message on their roof to ""mock their nosy neighbours"" spying on Google Maps, but the stunt backfired. The property in Lake County, Illinois , US, was spotted by a Facebook user who couldn't help posting a screenshot of the cheeky giant graffiti. Google's images show a birds-eye view of the black roof which has ""watch p*rn, not me,"" scrawled on top in white-coloured block capitals. The message appears to be a swipe at Google Maps enthusiasts whose hobby is to search aerial images for interesting discoveries - or perhaps some nosy neighbours. The Facebook post from July 22 now has more than 120,000 interactions with some saying the homeowners plan has seriously backfired as ""the entire world"" is now watching their property . Historical Google Maps images show the text has been on the roof since 2008 and it has faded during the past two years. The Facebook post by a Google Maps enthusiast said: ""Near Chicago . Soon it should be a law to have a quote on your roof."" One commented: ""This poor guy or whoever is probably seeing this and thinking 'well sh*t, that didn't work out'. A second said: ""And then suddenly, the entire world was watching THEM."" One more joked: ""I can't disagree with the homeowner."" It's unclear who wrote the taunting message but social media users believe it was the homeowner. But this isn't the first time internet users have been left in hysterics from Google Maps finds as in 2021 one Reddit user spotted an angry neighbour's message etched into a lawn. A screengrab from the maps website shows the word ""b****"" spelled out in capital letters in the grass behind a home in Salt Lake City, Utah , with an arrow pointing next door. And in 2018, lewd pictures of a large penis and breasts were discovered decorating the roofs of two homes on Google Earth. The illustrations were discovered two years after the apartment blocks were completed in Sweden – leaving homeowners baffled about who painted the X-rated images.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stunt-backfired-tens-thousands-now-834397038.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stunt-backfired-tens-thousands-now-834397163.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stunt-backfired-tens-thousands-now-834397110.jpg",Homeowner scrawls X-rated message on their roof to ‘mock nosy neighbours’ spying on Google Maps – but stunt backfires,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23207797/x-rated-message-roof-nosy-neighbours-spying-google/

Footage from TikTok shows dozens of kids splashing around in the water before the shocking incident begins to unfold. In the video, posted by Lifeguard Rescue , dozens of swimmers appear to be enjoying the dip before danger strikes. The lifeguard can be seen perched on his chair as he carefully overlooks the packed pool. But one young girl, who appears to be swimming peacefully begins to thrash around in the water. With so many people around, the lifeguard doesn't spot the kid straight away, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. As she turns his head away from the camera, he jumps out of his seat and runs down the poolside in front of the struggling child. He throws himself into the pool and grabs the drowning kid while other swimmers watch on in shock. The heroic lifeguard bravely pulls the child to the side of the pool as people gather round to offer their help. At the end of the clip, the crowd can be seen lifting her out of the pool and returning her to the safety of dry land. The post racked up 3,473 likes and over 60 comments from shocked viewers.

"A BRITISH teenager has died after collapsing at a nightclub in Ibiza in the early hours of this morning. The 19-year-old was rushed to hospital from Amnesia shortly before 5am. Sources say the teen went into cardiac arrest before paramedics arrived. They stabilised him at the scene before racing him to Can Misses Hospital in the island capital at about 6.30am. He died less than an hour later and cops are now investigating. Amnesia Ibiza is a popular nightclub near the village of San Rafael on the road between San Antonio and Ibiza Town. It was holding a summer-season weekly party called Bresh last night. An entry on its website says: “Every Thursday from June 8th until August 31st, BRESH! lands at Amnesia “The enigmatic party with top artists that has already landed in more than twenty countries, and now returns to Ibiza the most beautiful party in the world.” A local health source confirmed the patient admitted to Can Misses was a 19-year-old British national. He said: “The initial call came in at 4.50am this morning. “Emergency responders were asked to attend a nightspot on the road between San Antonio and Ibiza Town where a 19-year-old man had gone into cardiac arrest. “He was brought out of cardiac arrest by the responders at the scene and stabilised before being transferred to Can Misses Hospital. “He was admitted to A&E at Can Misses at 6.30am but was confirmed dead at 7.22am today despite attempts to save him.” A police spokesman confirmed the death was being probed. They said: “We are investigating and awaiting the results of the post-mortem.” One well-placed insider said the question of whether the dead teenager had been drinking or consumed drugs before he collapsed would be investigated as part of the process. There is no official information at this stage suggesting he was under the influence of drink or drugs before he went into cardiac arrest. It is not yet clear if he lived on the island or was on holiday, and whether he was alone or with friends. It comes after a British tourist died after plunging from a second-floor balcony near Wayne Lineker's nightclub on the island. The 35-year-old died on July 4 at the party resort in San Antonio. Emergency services rushed to the area but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Another Brit died near the same location last month after falling from the third floor of a hotel .

"THE dismembered body of a wealthy crypto tycoon has been found stuffed in a suitcase by a group of children playing near a stream. The mangled remains of Fernando Pérez Algaba, 39, had horrifically been dumped by the water in Ingeniero Budge, Argentina . Two youngsters chillingly stumbled across the abandoned red suitcase while playing football near the stream last Sunday. Fernando, a self-made millionaire who flaunted his luxury lifestyle on social media , had been reported missing four days earlier. He had flown to Argentina from his home in Barcelona for a seven-day trip, but never returned the keys to his rented apartment. The kids raised the alarm and rushed to inform their parents after discovering his bullet-riddled body in the town in Buenos Aires. When police arrived at the scene, they discovered Fernando's forearm and legs at the polluted stream. After dredging the water, cops then gruesomely discovered a complete arm lurking in the depths. The chopped-up corpse was identified as Fernando thanks to his distinctive tattoos and fingerprint analysis. His dismembered body parts are said to have been ""cleanly amputated"", according to local media. An autopsy found the businessman, who was nicknamed ""Lechuga"" (Lettuce), was killed by three gunshot wounds. Focus has now fallen on the perpetrators behind the brutal murder of social media star Fernando and possible motives. Just days before his limbs were discovered, the influencer had posted a series of cryptic messages on his Instagram account. He told his 919,000 followers there were ""evil people"" in the world and mysteriously wrote about being unable to escape from his ""problems."" In one clip, the heavily-inked crypto mogul shared a selfie in one of his flash cars with chilling accompanying audio. It said: ""It's incredible how there are such evil people in the world that while you're thinking of helping them, they're thinking of destroying you."" Fernando also sent a puzzling message, seemingly to his mother, explaining he ""needs to clear his head."" It read: ""And from here, I am realising two things: that we can't escape from problems and that problems will follow us."" He typically posted snaps of him in fast cars, enjoying luxury holidays and dripping in designer clothes. During his rags-to-riches journey to success, Fernando seemed to have landed himself in hot water with the law . He allegedly registered several companies through notaries in recent years - although one was reported for fraud, another had no tax identification number and a third was in debt. Lawsuits were opened against him, with creditors unsuccessfully pursuing him for years. The brawny businessman's wallet and phone were missing when police searched his rented apartment, reports claim. The landlord was due to meet Fernando on July 19, but he failed to turn up to exchange the keys for the pad. The entrepreneur has an impressive backstory leading up to his status as a crypto king who made a fortune on the stock market. Fernando first started working at the age of 14, selling sandwiches and delivering pizzas across his hometown. He then ventured into the automotive industry and began buying vehicles to repair and resell. By the time he was 24, the influencer had a huge warehouse jam-packed with high-end motors, motorcycles and jet skis. He later founded a car and jetski rental company in Miami , US , before moving to Barcelona in Spain , earlier this year. Fernando focused on his crypto investments and currency trading, heading up an office with over 25 employees in Puerto Madero, Argentina. It is unclear whether any arrests have been made in connection with his death. The investigation continues.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fernando-p-rez-algaba-millionaire-834432817.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fernando-p-rez-algaba-millionaire-834433112.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-stream-body-fernando-834419629.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-fernando-perez-algaba-834419279.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-suitcase-inside-remains-834419539.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fernando-p-rez-algaba-millionaire-834432908.jpg",Mystery as Crypto tycoon is found chopped up in suitcase after flaunting luxury lifestyle & posting about ‘evil people’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23211000/crypto-tycoon-chopped-up-suitcase-posts-about-evil-people/
"A PET owner who owns the ""world's largest cat"" claims he's as tall as her four-year-old daughter and can even open doors himself. Yuli Minina's took to Instagram to show her followers shocking footage of her Maine Coon standing on his back legs and letting himself into the garden. The huge cat , named Kefir, was seen leaning on a door with paws as he hit the handle and opened it. He then stretches his gigantic body out under the sun and trots around the patio area before hopping up onto a sun lounger in a true human style. Kefir is filmed cheekily rolling around in a vegetable patch before perching himself on a branch, making him look more like a lion than a cat. The video racked up over 2,200 likes and pet lovers across Instagram were left blown away by his size. One wrote: ""Look at the size of that cat!"" Another said: ""Wow, what a good looking kitty! Kefir, you are a walking cotton"". A third commented: ""We want more Kefir videos, this giant cat is so pretty!"" The massive feline even has his own TikTok page where Yuli posts updates on his bizarre growth and clips of him playing around. In one video, she has documented the journey from when she first bought him in 2020 to now. Kefir can be seen looking tiny while tucked into Yuli's neck before she shows him looking a little larger in her lap. She then shares a snap of the big cat stretched out on a table as he takes up almost half of the available space. In the next clip, she shows her followers a hilarious picture of Kefir on a pink scooter as he stands on the footrest and holds the handlebars with ease. In each photo, Kefir grows longer and wider until he is eventually seen taking up an entire desk while relaxing on top. The enormous feline, who lives with Yulia in Stary Oskol, Russia , became a viral sensation in 2022 as the moggie was set to beat a world record. Weighing 12.5kg (27.5lbs) at just one year and ten months old, the giant cat was still just considered a kitten. Yulia explained: ""I could not even think that an ordinary baby can become so big. ""He not only grew up big in appearance, he is also very smart and always behaves calmly"". She also revealed that at night time, Kefir had a habit of climbing onto her which made sleeping increasingly difficult due to his sheer size. ""Maine Coons grow up to 3-4 years. Therefore, I think it should become even larger,"" she added.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a44e6bb3-d2e9-496a-a95f-03825c923f1c.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/s-tall-4-year-old-834472041.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/317e981c-39c9-4028-b4e3-6ac4ddfd4f6d.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/s-tall-4-year-old-834467677.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/s-tall-4-year-old-834467808.jpg",I own the world’s largest cat – he’s as tall as my 4-year-old daughter and stands on his back legs to open doors,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23211919/worlds-largest-cat-tall-daughter-open-doors/
"A HOLIDAYMAKER revealed how she was sick of queuing for sunbeds at a Spanish resort - so she decided to take matters into her own hands. Sonya Romina took to TikTok to share the sneaky method her mum used to nab a lounger while on holiday. The ten-second clip, captioned: ""I ain't got time to waste,"" begins with two women standing against the railing near a pool at the Torremolinos resort. Decked in shorts and flip-flops, the pair appear to be keeping a watchful eye on the decking area near the hotel's swimming pool. Then with hilarious ease, the women begin lifting each end of a white sunbed over the metal rail before resting it for a second. After the chair is half-way over the wall, they continue to drag it until it tumbles onto the grass. The two sneaky ladies then pick it back up and turn around before carrying it off to their desired loaction. Sonya wrote on the post: ""When there's a 20 person line so my mum decides to steal the sunbed"". The post racked up over 200 likes with one person leaving a series of laughing emojis in response to the cheeky clip. But with holiday season approaching, these two women aren't the first to share their sunbed hogging experiences. A British tourist, and self-proclaimed King of the Sunbeds, revealed to The Sun Online how to always nab the best loungers while you're on holiday. He said: ""My first top tip is to get your deck chairs at about 7.30 in the morning. ""It's likely the pool attendants would have cleaned the floor around that time and would have moved all the chairs ready for the day."" Benidorm beachgoers have also been seen trying to beat Brits by setting up their sunbeds in the middle of the night. Snaps show locals scurrying towards the seafront with their deckchairs in hand as they prepare to bag the best spots. Images show them setting up large umbrellas by staking the pole through the sand in a bid to claim their territory before the Brit holidaymakers wake up. And security guards were filmed ripping off sunbed hoggers' towels at a Tenerife resort. The brazen poolside ""policing"" was captured by a hotel guest and has since gone viral on social media . Footage showed the security team inspecting the sun loungers, appearing to make note of how long the towels had been there. Once they identified the offenders, the workers collected the towels and removed them so other guests could enjoy some sun.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0a0635cb-01e5-4106-87cc-32a7e3a8dafd.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/009f503d-8fad-4957-b22b-8e8a94a45c17.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cd480ecc-5d32-4d07-a870-85ad87f4b9e1.jpg",We were sick of queuing for sunbeds at Spanish resort – so we took matters into our own hands,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23212997/sick-queuing-sunbeds-spanish-resort-matters-own-hands/
"HOLIDAYMAKERS heading to Spain have been warned they could face a £260 fine for hogging prime beach spots using towels and sun shades. Torrox has become the third town in Malaga to introduce fines from £43 to £260 for those who reserve a spot at the beach. The move comes after fed-up locals reported not being able to find a spot on the beach in the morning with tourists reserving spots by plonking down umbrellas, chairs, and towels before going back to their hotels . One told local media that the practice is so widespread it is impossible for locals to ""get up later than eight in the morning because otherwise, they won't have a spot"". Spanish police said that if they find unattended belongings on the beach, they will wait for one hour and, if no one returns within that time, the items will be seized. If the confiscated items are not claimed within the next ten days they will be destroyed. The tourists must pay the fine to get them back if they are claimed. Torrox municipality lists among its prohibitions ""the reservation of physical space on the beaches, at any time of the day or night, by placing any type of object or items (chairs, umbrellas, tables, tents, etc.) on the sand without the physical presence of the owner"". Similar bans are in place in the towns of Velez and Algarrobo, while authorities in Gandia, Torrevieja, Cullera, and Oropesa del Mar in Valencia also dish out financial penalties to offenders. Meanwhile, a similar rule exists in popular Benidorm where a sunbed war has erupted between locals and tourists. Spanish council chiefs have said they will get tough with repeat offenders after photos emerged of locals trying to beat Brit tourists to prime spots by setting up sunbeds in the middle of the night. And another Brit holiday destination has revealed that any belongings found on their beaches before 9.30am will be removed - and the owners fined. The Calpe Council has introduced an ordinance which prohibits chairs, hammocks and umbrellas from being placed on the beaches early in the morning.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000834456899.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000834457031-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/proudly-planting-flags-sand-shoreline-834402905.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/proudly-planting-flags-sand-shoreline-834403062.jpg",Holiday warning as tourists face £260 fine for hogging prime beach spaces in top Brit hotspot,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23216385/holiday-warning-tourists-fine-hogging-beach-spaces/
"THIS is the bizarre moment a naked woman opened fire on drivers on one of America's busiest bridges. The strange scene happened on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge in California during rush hour. Authorities rushed to the scene after a driver reported to 911 that someone threatened them with a gun around 4.40pm, the New York Post reported. California Highway Patrol said a woman stopped in the middle of the road, got out of her car wielding a knife and started shouting at other drivers. She reportedly went back into her car and kept driving before stopping again at the toll plaza, stripping naked and brandishing a gun at other drivers. The woman then began shooting randomly at cars, police said. Dramatic footage showed her firing into the air before cops arrived at the scene and convinced her to drop her weapon. After initially refusing to do so, the woman finally agreed to leave her weapon on the ground before she was taken into custody. Luckily no injuries were reported in the incident and the woman was placed on a mental health hold in a local hospital , cops said. Earlier this month five people died and two children were wounded after a gunman wearing a bulletproof vest opened fire on the streets of Philadelphia. Two boys, aged two and 13, were among the seven victims gunned down in the bloody rampage on Monday - just hours before Fourth of July celebrations. While in Baltimore two people were killed and 28 injured after a mass shooting at a Fourth of July weekend block party. The shooting occurred at an event known as Brooklyn Day where hundreds had gathered to celebrate, according to WBFF-TV .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gun-horror-bizarre-moment-naked-834487444-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gun-horror-bizarre-moment-naked-834487386-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gun-horror-bizarre-moment-naked-834487385.jpg",Bizarre moment a naked woman opens fire at drivers on one of America’s busiest bridges during rush hour,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23217788/bizarre-moment-naked-woman-opens-fire-drivers/
"HOLIDAYMAKERS ready to jet to the Balearics have been issued a warning about swimming. Several swimmers in Majorcan beaches reported leaving the water with bite marks. A local named Montse Terradas told the newspaper he has come out of the water with bites on more than one occasion. He said: ""We noticed that some fish was brushing against us, but then it bit me. ""They were bloody wounds, the same thing happened to my sister and we also had to be treated by the lifeguard. He added that he was told that there had been another fifteen cases on the beach that day. Another swimmer who was also bitten added: ""They must feel that their habitat is being invaded, the lifeguard told us."" The swimmer said the fish ""could measure up to 30 centimetres, but at first glance they appear and are harmless"". In some cases, beachgoers were left with a small bleeding wound after being bitten by fish. Earlier this week, holidaymakers were warned of a mystery substance that has forced four top beaches to close. Red flags have been raised to prohibit swimming along the coast of the holiday hotspot resort of El Puig, near Valencia after a strange white matter washed up. And last week tourists in Ibiza were being turned away from a favourite island beach - following a disgusting discovery. Visitors have been told to avoid Ibiza's Playa Es Pinet after the cove's water was found to contain faecal matter. Earlier this month tourists were warned over a ""ticking timebomb"" Spanish beach which could be turned into a ""dead zone"" by a dangerous shipwreck.

"UKRAINE has smashed through Russian front lines in a huge tank assault. President Zelensky said his “guys had very good results”. He promised: “More details later.” Russia’s Vladimir Putin admitted fighting had intensified significantly. Terrified Russian officials in occupied Zaporizhzhia in the south claimed thousands of Ukrainian troops had launched a lightning push on Wednesday with 100 German Leopard tanks and US Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Moscow insisted its troops had repelled the assaults. But think tank The Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine had broken through pre-prepared defensive positions in a “significant mechanised counteroffensive”. Analysts said Ukraine’s force was smaller than Moscow had claimed. Footage showed troops advanced several kilometres around the village of Robotyne. Pro-war Russian blogger Rybar said fierce battles were raging. Ukraine's forces are understood to be advancing in the direction of Novoprokopivka and Verbove in Zaporizhzhya region. Ukraine is trying to cut supply lines to Crimea . US officials said the blitz was the main thrust of Ukraine’s summer push. But Western sources insisted Kyiv had still not committed its main reserve force, which includes UK Challenger 2 tanks. Progress has been slow due to well-made Russian minefields and trenches. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar reported more progress near Bakhmut . Putin’s Russia-Africa summit appeared to flop in St Petersburg . Just 17 leaders attended, down from 43 two years ago. Moscow claimed officials from 49 of Africa’s 54 nations were there. It comes as Ukrainian forces pressed their counteroffensive through the Russian-occupied southeast on Thursday. Troops claim to have captured the village of Staromaiorske in a campaign to drive a wedge through Russian defensive positions.= A video posted on Zelensky's Telegram channel showed Ukrainian soldiers celebrating the capture of Staromaiorske in the southeast. The village lies to the south of a cluster of small settlements that Ukraine recaptured along the Mokri Yaly River as the counteroffensive began. Zelensky has said that the counteroffensive is proceeding more slowly than he would like but warned people not to expect rapid results akin to a movie scene. On Wednesday he hailed ""very good results"" on the battlefield, while giving no details.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ukrainian-soldier-tank-performs-firing-806568487-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epa10771457-handout-photo-made-available-834453424.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DD-MAP-ukraine-breakthrough.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/air-cannon-fired-ukrainian-artillery-832278623-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ukrainian-soldiers-say-recaptured-ukrainian-834502994.jpg",Ukraine smashes through Russian frontlines in huge tank assault as Zelensky praises ‘very good results’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23219171/ukraine-russian-frontlines-tank-assault-war-zelensky/
"THE worst wildfires in living memory were still burning across Greece earlier tonight — as a drop in temperature slowed their progress. But the country’s climate crisis minister, Vassilis Kikilias, warned: “Nothing is over, the battle will continue throughout the summer.” The flames still had a hold in several regions, with 61 separate fires remaining alight across the country — in Rhodes, Corfu , Evia and close to Athens. In Rhodes, dramatic drone ­footage showed a huge black scar scorched from the middle of the island to the town of Kiotari on the east coast. New fires erupted in the cities of Volos and Lamia. Blazes have also reached the outskirts of Athens . Residents have been evacuated from Magnesia, a coastal area north of the capital. Crete , popular with thousands of British tourists, also remains on high alert. The Greek fire brigade warned the risk of fire remained “extreme” for several areas of the country. More than 40 people have died in Greece, Italy and Algeria as a result of recent fires. The majority of deaths, 34, occurred in the North African country.

"A TREASURE hunter who bought a locked box from a charity shop was left amazed with what they found inside. TikToker @Bearded_Thrifter made the stunning discovery after he took a punt on a mystery box at a Goodwill Bins outlet. The US man filmed the scavenging adventure as he rummaged through charity bins in hope to strike it lucky. Eventually, he set his sights on a locked pink jewellery box with a Batman sticker on it. He said: ""We went to a Goodwill Bins where you pay for everything by the pound and we found this mystery pink Batman box. ""We gave it a good shake test and it sounded like there was either metal coins or jewellery so we took the $5 gamble because it weighed 3lbs.

In the video, the man then showed viewers how he resorted to a hammer to ply open the seal. When it released, inside was a treasure trove of jewellery. He added: ""We did find jewellery in there but unfortunately most of it was not really worth anything to my knowledge. ""We also found a key but it didn't belong to the box.

"A MAN and woman have died after two planes collided mid-air above an airport in Australia this morning. The pair, both in their 60s, died at the scene near Brisbane at around 10.30am local time. Footage shows the horror wreckage of both planes lying smashed into pieces on the runway. Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief, Angus Mitchell, said the light aircrafts involved were a Jabiru J430 and a Piper Pawnee. The J430 was taking off from one runway just as the Pawnee was landing on a crossing runway at Caboolture Airfield, he said. ""Tragically, both occupants of the Jabiru were fatally injured. The Pawnee pilot was uninjured."" The other pilot, aged around 70, is now assisting police in the investigation. Matt Davis, senior operations supervisor from Queensland's ambulance service, described the scene as ""extremely traumatic"" for paramedics. “Any incident involving the loss of life, particularly under these circumstances, is extremely difficult and hard, obviously for the first responders and most importantly for the family,” he told 9News . “Our hearts certainly go out to [their] family.” Superintendent Paul Ready said it was ""quite lucky"" that the other pilot had survived ""when you look at the damage on the ground"". ""It occurred low to the ground at the eastern end of the airfield,"" he added. Police have asked any witnesses to come forward. “There will be people who may well have seen some of the aircraft and their movements prior to the collision,"" Ready said.

"THIS is the terrifying moment wildfires in central Greece reached an ammunition dump and blasted a huge fireball into the air. Strong winds whipped the fires across the Volos region , where they triggered a series of violent explosions near to an air force base that turned the sky blood red. The large explosions shattered windows of homes in nearby villages and could be heard 12 miles away in the city of Volos. The site - which had already been evacuated - was used to store explosives for Greek fighter jets and is only 4 miles north of a major military airbase in Nea Anchialos. Greece's Airforce confirmed that F-16 fighter jets had been stored at the airfield near to the site and have been moved, but they insisted the base itself was not under an immediate threat. By late last night, the fires at the ammunition depot had finally been put out and no injuries were reported. Chief Civil Defence General Konstantinos Floros said: ""What happened will be thoroughly investigated. If there are responsibilities, they will be assigned. Fully."" ""I want to assure you that there was no security issue for the 111th Fighter Wing itself."" The inferno continues to rip through the area of Volos-Nea Anchialos where Fire Service spokesman Ioannis Artopios said 12 villages had been ordered to evacuate. ""Despite their superhuman efforts, our forces were unable to stop the blaze,"" he said. The Volos area wildfire, he added, was the most dangerous of the 124 wildfires the fire serviced dealt with on Thursday. Local media showed chaotic scenes of residents being evacuated by the sea, while others were quickly sent away on cars and buses. The Volos fires have also impacted the city's supply of water and electricity, while residents have been told to stay indoors to avoid the heavy black smoke in the area. Wildfires are raging across parts of Greece following three successive Mediterranean heat waves, which triggered a huge weekend evacuation of tourists on the island of Rhodes. The violent blazes appeared to slow slightly yesterday after a drop in temperature. However, the country's climate crisis minister, Vassilis Kikilias, warned: “Nothing is over, the battle will continue throughout the summer.” As of last night, the flames still had a hold in several regions, with 61 separate fires remaining alight across the country — in Rhodes, Corfu, Evia, Athens region and now Volos. Crete , popular with thousands of British tourists, also remains on ""high alert"". The blazes across the country, which have been supercharged by strong winds and temperatures exceeding 40C have killed five, including two firefighter pilots. Thousands of British holidaymakers have been left stranded in the burning country as a host of airlines cancelled flights for the foreseeable future. Brits have been forced to sleep on airport floors waiting for a spot on a repatriation flight - serving as a stark warning to those who were due to travel to Greece. Tour operators are now shunting travellers to resorts across Spain as a consolation prize for their holiday plans that have been shattered. The World Meteorological Organization declared on Thursday that temperatures during the first three weeks of July set a new global heat record.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/exdplosshshshs.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/explsoshs.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/JW-MAP-GREECE-AIRBASE-FIRE-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefighter-tries-extinguish-wildfire-burning-834308545.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/000-cubic-meters-per-hour-834301098.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a524acbc-b1df-4242-b1a4-8daedf19f61a.jpg",Moment Greek wildfire hit military ammunitions dump sparking huge fireball blast that turns sky blood red,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23220811/moment-greek-wildfire-hit-military-ammunitions-dump-fireball/
"A WOMAN revealed how she got fined £200 after jealous neighbours reported her for taking sexy snaps by the pool. Flora Favaretto was slapped with the hefty fine after taking the racy pictures outside her luxury home . The Brazilian adult content star admitted that she had taken a few low-key snaps by the swimming pool but said that it was nothing controversial. After being handed the £200 fine, Flora blamed the jealous women in the condo she lives in, claiming they were unhappy at their husbands peering at her. The OnlyFans model, who is originally from Rodonia, makes a fortune by inviting her fans to send her their racy pictures, offering prizes including a free subscription to her channel with private calls and videos. She makes a separate charge to carry out evaluation and thanks to the idea says she is making an extra £5,000 a month on top of her existing income from OnlyFans and Privacy. The extra income meant that she was rich enough to put down a down payment on her new home in Sao Paulo . She said: “I never imagined that I would buy an apartment trading in nudes. I even launched a ranking among subscribers. ""I have no idea how many nudes I've seen, I even lost count. I like that, I feel like a sexual critique. Men like to show off too. I discovered that this is their biggest fetish, more than any other."" About her future plans, she adds: ""I'm always creating news and listening to my subscribers. ""Another fetish of theirs is public display, and I'm preparing a special collection."" This comes after a plus-size influencer was put behind bars for two years and fined £2,600 for sharing sexy snaps on Instagram and TikTok in April. Salma El-Shimi was jailed after being found guilty of publishing ""inappropriate content on social media in exchange for financial gain"". The curvaceous content creator previously found herself in hot water with Egyptian authorities in December 2020. Salma was arrested after posing for a saucy photoshoot in front of the 4,700-year-old Pyramid of Djoser outside Cairo . And Katie Price risked prison or a £2,000 fine after posting racy OnlyFans content from Thailand in february. The former glamour model, 44, posed in pink lingerie while on a trip to the country, which has very strict laws on sexy content posted online. Publishing ""obscene"" content online is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, a 100,000-baht (£2,300) fine, or both.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2c70e9ae-39d7-4f5c-9c70-2a727493de18.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9e524153-fad5-4ff1-bff9-be8f693b684d.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flora-favaretto-poses-undated-photo-834606184.jpg",I got £200 fine after jealous neighbour reported me for taking sexy poolside snaps – I can’t help it if husbands stare,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23224205/200-fine-jealous-neighbour-reported-sexy-snaps-husbands-stare/
"AUSTRALIA'S luckiest lottery suburbs have been revealed as the latest Powerball jackpot goes up for grabs. The $60 million prize was the second biggest windfall offered by any Australian lottery game this year — second only to last month's $100 million win. New data revealed some Aussie suburbs are luckier than others when it comes to winning big. While the last Powerball winner was a lucky Bankstown dad who scored the whopping $100 million, Victoria has actually had the most division one winners of the past year. Nobody has claimed this week's $60 million jackpot yet. However, if it goes to another New South Wales resident, there is a strong chance they could be from Sydney's west. ""There were six suburbs that each sold three division one wins, Springvale South/Dingley Village, Doreen/Mernda, the Melbourne CBD, Wyndham, Endeavour Hills and Lalor,"" The Lott's Matt Hart told nine.com.au . He added that Berala had more winners, as did Dapto on the South Coast. In Queensland Nerang and Morayfield had more winners while South Australia boasted winners from Gawler and Oaklands Park. Tasmanian winners were mostly from Sorelle﻿ and Rosny Park and Kalgoorlie in WA struck gold with five division one winners. ""Yarrawonga sold the biggest prize from an in-store ticket in the Northern Territory,"" Hart said. ""The most frequently drawn numbers, 17, 7, 9, 3 and 28 and the most frequently drawn of the Powerball are the numbers, 2, 3 and 19."" If you're hoping to be Australia's next big millionaire it's time to see if you struck gold. Thursday night's winning numbers are: 19, 14, 18, 22, 16, 4, 33. The lucky Powerball number is: 18. The chances of claiming a Division One Powerball prize are about 134.5 million to one. But don't lose hope, because a total of 303 millionaires were created by division one wins in Australia in the last financial year – the equivalent of almost one a day, Yahoo Australia reported. The UK's luckiest place , where residents are most likely to win the postcode lottery , has also been revealed. The People's Postcode Lottery was launched in 2005 and gives out a million pounds to Brits every week - based entirely on where they live. But residents in a Shropshire town have been named the luckiest in the UK , according to new research. People living in Telford have most often been selected as weekly winners of the jackpot, having racked up an average of 42.14 wins per 10,000 households, BirminghamLive reports. The town is followed by Shrewsbury, where an average of 41.57 wins have been recorded.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000662654246.jpg,Australia’s luckiest lottery suburbs revealed as $60million Powerball jackpot goes up for grabs,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23224309/australia-luckiest-lottery-suburbs-revealed-powerball/
"A WOMAN revealed how she stashed her £5,000 life savings into a cardboard box but was left devastated when she returned to use it. Khairul Azhar took to Facebook to share the grisly story behind his grandma's nightmare situation. The bloke from Malaysia wrote in a post: ""Today, I found out that the £5,000 that my grandmother saved to attend the haj next year was eaten by termites."" He attached a snap of the cardboard shoe box used to store the ringgit notes which had been completely destroyed. The green and red notes appeared to be shredded, and some had circular bite marks along the edges. Khairul said that he handed over half of the money that wasn't chomped through to The Central Bank of Malaysia, Bank Negara, but the rest could not be saved. ""It is not my grandmother's (fortune) to go to Mecca . Lesson learnt. Don't keep so much cash at home ,"" he added. The post has racked up over 200 comments and 260 likes, with many viewers left devastated for the elderly woman. Others decided to leave the grandma some money -storing advice after claiming it was her own fault for keeping her money packed away in a box. One Facebook user said a better option would have been to keep the money in a biscuit tin. Many suggested exchanging the cash for gold bars because even depositing money in banks could leave her susceptible to scams. This comes after a pensioner lost his life savings of £17,000 after donating a sofa forgetting he had hidden the cash inside. The man has issued a desperate plea to find the buyer and even offered a reward, hoping to retrieve part of the money. A dad also told how he lost his entire life savings when he fell for an elaborate investment scam after selling his family home. Borja Ares, 37, said he ""failed his wife and children"" after being duped into handing over £160,000 to professional con artists . And one couple said they felt ""cheated"" after spending their life savings on their dream newbuild, which they claimed was a nightmare.

"KIM Jong-un has showcased his new ballistic nuke missiles and drones as he flexes North Korea's military muscle at the West. The tyrant watched on as the terrifying weapons were flaunted in a mighty military parade in Pyongyang. Kim stood shoulder to shoulder with Chinese and Russian officials as they reviewed his newest nuclear -capable missiles and attack drones in the capital. In a chilling warning to the West, at least four new military drones were towed through Kim Il Sung Square on Thursday. New attack and spy drones were also flown overhead in a show of strength, the KCNA state news agency reported. The new surveillance drones could be used to survey targets, assess damage and generally enhance situational awareness, according to Ankit Panda of the US -based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Kim, Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu and Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Li Hongzhong talked, laughed and saluted as North Korean troops marched and weapons rolled past. The parade is also understood to have included North Korea's latest Hwasong-17 and Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles. They are believed to have the range to strike anywhere in the United States. In a speech at the parade, North Korean Defence Minister General Kang Sun Nam accused the US and its allies of increasing tension in the region. It comes after a US Trident missile submarine docked in South Korea - the first time the US has sent a nuclear-armed submarine to South Korea since 1981. The parade came as North Korea marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Korean War armistice, known as Victory Day. Vladimir Putin 's crony Shoigu jetted into the hermit kingdom this week amid celebrations as Russia cosies up to North Korea in a bid to get weapons to use in Ukraine . Kim hosted a reception and lunch with him and vowed solidarity with Russia's people and military. Shoigu praised the North Korean military as the strongest in the world, and the two discussed strategic security and defence cooperation, KCNA said. At another meeting, Shoigu read a congratulatory message from Putin, who thanked North Korea for its support during the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, media reported. The US has accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine, which both nations have denied. State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said on Thursday the US was ""incredibly concerned"" about their ties. North Korea has been under UN sanctions for its missile and nuclear programmes since 2006. It is banned from developing ballistic missiles.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d85b9aca-123c-42b7-a5f2-8db2b3909c6f.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-kcna-via-kns-afp-834609135.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-kcna-via-kns-afp-834612111.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-kcna-via-eyepress-photo-834635877.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-widely-anticipated-parade-capital-834635949.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kim-il-sung-square-pyongyang-834612116.jpg",Kim Jong-un shows off new ballistic nuke missiles & drones in warning to West after US moves nuke sub to region,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23225989/kim-jong-un-ballistic-missiles-drones/
"A HOMEOWNER was left baffled when she found a 6ft pole cemented into her driveway. The bizarre object sent New Zealander Sophie Hucker on a wild goose chase with no one claiming responsibility for the metal rod. The mystery began on Tuesday when the woman returned home from a day of teaching only to find the plastic-wrapped eyesore obstructing her parking space. She told the Bay of Plenty Times: ""I thought maybe the neighbours ordered something - maybe it's a pole for a basketball hoop."" However, when the Tauranga woman tried to move it - the pole didn't budge. She added: ""I saw and said 'oh s***' it's cemented in."" Sophie's next guess was that her neighbour could have ordered it to build a carport and the tradesman had got the wrong home. She also reportedly contacted Tauranga City Council who knew nothing of the matter. With no avail, she decided to leave a note on the pole with her phone number that read: ""I have no idea what this is doing here - please call me."" She added: ""I've got no answers. ""My current conclusion is that some tradies made a big stuff-up and just left it, which is annoying and random. ""It's not even round to swing around on."" The pole isn't completely blocking the entry to her home, however, Sophie admitted the unwanted object had caused her grief. She has since taken to Facebook to see if any locals could shed some light. However, it only sparked a jovial debate. ""Have you called the pole-ice,"" a Facebook user said. ""I find this post offensive, can you please remove it,"" one added. Despite the jokes, Sophie pleaded for the original gift-bearer to reclaim the pole. She said: ""You've provided a lot of entertainment value for everyone, but can you please come and get rid of it. ""I do not need that pole.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sophie-jessica-hucker-834633773-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9f409c83-5c0b-4757-a93c-9a5a6deae624.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/75afff19-a98e-4d93-bd43-bb84ef55e82a.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sophie-jessica-hucker-834633772.jpg",I was completely baffled after finding 6ft pole cemented into my driveway – no one knows how it got there,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23215829/pole-cemented-into-driveway-resident-baffled/
"A BRITISH man has been arrested on suspicion of stabbing his girlfriend’s “lover” after discovering them at his home in Majorca. The 28-year-old allegedly went berserk after catching the couple unawares in the early hours of this morning on the popular Spanish island. Police sources said that the suspect knifed his partner's alleged lover in the ribs during a struggle. The injured man, a 32-year-old Moroccan national, was rushed to Son Espases Hospital near the Majorcan capital Palma in a “serious condition.” Spanish cops swarmed the property in Santa Ponsa - a short drive from Magaluf - which the alleged knifeman fled after the incident. The alarm was raised around 3.45am this morning. A spokesman for the Civil Guard in Majorca said: “I can confirm we have arrested a 28-year-old British national on suspicion of attempted homicide. “He remains in police custody.” Well-placed sources confirmed local reports the Moroccan man who had been stabbed was the alleged attacker’s lover. The nationality of the British man’s partner, who is reported to have raised the alarm, has not been made public. It was not immediately clear this afternoon if the two lovers were in bed together when the Brit walked in on them. It comes as earlier this month, cops launched a manhunt for a British ex-con who allegedly stabbed his girlfriend during a row at a Costa del Sol beach club. The 36-year-old is said to have knifed his partner who then fell from a moving car as they left a venue in Mijas Costa near Fuengirola. The attacker, who fled the scene, is believed to have several convictions for violent crime in the UK.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-man-arrested-suspicion-stabbing-834669523.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-man-arrested-suspicion-stabbing-834669584.jpg","Brit, 28, arrested for ‘stabbing his girlfriend’s lover’ after finding them together at his home in Majorca",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23233058/brit-arrested-stabbing-girlfriends-lover-majorca/
"THIS is the shocking moment a little boy drowned in a crowded swimming pool after nobody noticed him struggling. The disturbing video was shot at a water park in Rostov-on-Don, Russia , on July 26. It shows the little boy standing on the edge and jumping into the water, seemingly without a problem. However, as the video progresses, the boy is seen getting into difficulties in the water and is obviously struggling to stay afloat. Yet other children and adults play around him, and it appears that nobody notices - not even the lifeguard . The kid can be seen thrashing around in the water as he floats further into the centre of the pool. It is only when he eventually ends up motionless in the water that the adults see the danger, and a woman rushes over and carries him out of the pool in her arms. Some reports said he was still alive when he was taken from the pool but had stopped breathing by the time medics arrived, and attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. Dina Filippova, a psychologist at the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia for the Rostov Region, said that it was surprising that a person can drown in front of others and no one will notice. She said: ""A person who does not have special training will never recognize a drowning person, whether it is an adult or a child. This can only be done by a rescuer who is on standby. ""When people drown, they do it silently, they don't have time to shout or call for help. It's a matter of a few seconds. And the movements of a drowning person are similar to those of someone just floundering in the water."" Local mayor Alexei Logvinenko said in a post on his Telegram channel on July 27 that they would begin inspecting all water parks in the region for safety. He wrote: ""Administration employees, together with the competent authorities, will check public places with outdoor pools for the presence of security measures: rescuers, medical workers."" The Investigative Committee of the local police force said: ""A criminal case has been initiated under Part 2 of Article 238 'Provision of services that do not meet the requirements for the safety of life or health, which negligently caused the death of a person'."" This comes after a child began to drown in a crowded swimming pool before a quick-thinking lifeguard jumped in to save them. An urgent warning was also issued to parents after a shocking video showed adults swimming past a drowning seven-year-old as he sank to the bottom of the pool. Parents were also urged to keep a firm eye on their kids at the pool after a four-year-old boy almost drowned in front of dozens of people at a Thai water park.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocking-moment-camera-captures-little-834685329.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/e63a3cc9-1c74-4047-8b5e-6b9f14c497eb.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-shows-pool-aqua-park-834649333-1.jpg",Warning to parents as harrowing video shows little boy drowning in crowded swimming pool after NOBODY notices,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23230784/little-boy-drowns-swimming-pool-nobody-sees-him-struggling/
"A MURDERED crypto boss reportedly left a chilling note describing how he feared for his life before his dismembered body was found stuffed in a suitcase. Fernando Pérez Algaba , 39, was allegedly being hounded by disgruntled creditors after a series of botched business deals. He jotted down his suspicions that his life was in danger and eerily wrote: ""If something happens to me, everyone is already warned."" Children playing near a stream in Ingeniero Budge, Argentina , later found his mutilated limbs and torso in a suitcase next to a stream. They discovered his bullet-ridden body four days after he had been reported missing when he did not return the keys to his rented flat. Despite flaunting his luxury lifestyle on social media , Fernando was reportedly drowning in debt before his death. Reports claimed he owed the tax man a hefty sum, while investors in his ""failed"" crypto businesses were also chasing him for cash. The entrepreneur admitted his finances had ""got out of hand"", but continued to parade his designer clothes and flash cars on Instagram . Fernando had recently bungled a £31,000 investment made by the son of a senior member of a local football hooligan firm, according to Argentine newspaper La Nación. In the mercy message sent to multiple contacts, he reportedly said he had asked the man to ""wait a few months for me to settle up."" But the struggling trader said his pleas had been ignored and he later got a call where he was ""threatened"", prompting him to write the disturbing note. It reportedly read: ""Hello, well, in principle I apologize to all the people that I failed them and I could not pay them what they gave me. ""At first this started as an investment in cryptocurrencies and, little by little, it got out of hand. Nothing that happened was on purpose. ""In each new attempt to get ahead, there was always the possibility of recovering what was lost. And there was the mistake."" Fernando's alleged debts with Argentina's tax authorities were dubbed ""irrecoverable"", further adding to his growing pressures. His brother Rodolfo Perez Algaba - who travelled to Buenos Aires to help locate him - said he was not a scammer, but admitted he had run into money troubles. Just days before his remains were found, the self-made millionaire had shared a series of cryptic Instagram posts. Fernando told his 919,000 followers there were ""evil people"" in the world and mysteriously wrote about being unable to escape from his ""problems."" His dumped torso and limbs were then discovered before police dredged the water and found his head in a rucksack downstream. The ""cleanly"" chopped-up corpse was identified as Fernando thanks to his distinctive tattoos and fingerprint analysis. He was said to have taken his French bulldog named Kupper on his travels, who is currently missing. An autopsy found the businessman, who was nicknamed ""Lechuga"" (Lettuce), was killed by three gunshot wounds. People are now questioning whether Fernando's flashy persona was a complete facade to hide his mounting debts and dangerous enemies. He touted himself as a crypto expert who could help others achieve success, which was propped up by his rags-to-riches tale to the top. The influencer claimed he had begun working at the age of 14, before he started buying vehicles to repair and resell. By the time he was 24, the influencer had a huge warehouse jam-packed with high-end motors, motorcycles and jet skis. He later founded a car and jetski rental company in Miami , US , before moving to Barcelona in Spain , earlier this year. Fernando had established a crypto investment and currency trading firm in Puerto Madero, Argentina, which had over 25 employees. He previously said he had ""lost everything"" on the stock market, before boasting that he turned £78,000 into £310,000 ""in four days"". But several companies he registered through notaries in recent years also reportedly ran into trouble. It is claimed that one was reported for fraud, another had no tax identification number and a third was in debt. Although the dismemberment of his body was precise, police do not currently believe Fernando was killed by an organised gang. Buenos Aires security minister Sergio Berni said the suspects acted ""quickly, almost madly"" and left a messy crime scene. ""A more professional criminal does it differently, not like this,"" he told C5N. ""The situation was very spectacular, a somewhat macabre event."" A woman is said to have been arrested in connection with the brutal murder after she was linked to paperwork found in the suitcase. Cops still believe there are other suspects at large. The investigation continues.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fernando-p-rez-algaba-millionaire-834433113-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fernando-p-rez-algaba-millionaire-834433175-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Newsflash-LuggageBusinessman-10jpeg-JS834419539.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fernando-p-rez-algaba-millionaire-834433079.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fernando-p-rez-algaba-millionaire-834433112-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/crypto-horror-murdered-crypto-boss-834675212.jpg",Murdered crypto boss ‘left chilling note fearing he could be bumped off’ before being found chopped up in suitcase,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23233419/murdered-crypto-boss-chilling-note-fearing-for-life-killed/
"A HUGE explosion rocked a Russian city today and left 15 injured in a major blow to Putin. The blast in Taganrog, near the Ukraine border, came amid reports of a sabotage bomb smashing into an oil plant in another part of Russia . Taganrog is a port city on the Black Sea - around 30 miles from Rostov-on-Don, one of Russia's biggest cities. Russia's ministry of defence blamed Ukraine for the explosion. It said: ""The Kyiv regime carried out a terrorist attack with an anti-aircraft missile of the S-200 air defence system converted into a strike version on the residential infrastructure of the city of Taganrog, Rostov Region. ""Russian air defence systems detected a Ukrainian missile and intercepted it in the air."" It said ""fragments"" of the Ukrainian missile fell in Taganrog. ""As a result of the terrorist attack committed by the Kyiv regime, several buildings were damaged, and there were also victims among civilians,"" the defence ministry added. The explosion injured 15 people, the governor of the Rostov region, Vasily Golubev, said. He said the epicentre of the explosion fell on the art museum. ""The wall of the museum, the roof, garages and outbuildings were destroyed. The frames in the windows and balconies of the neighbouring three-story apartment building were knocked out,"" he said. The head of the region said nine people were rushed to hospital. “Nine people were delivered to medical facilities, whose condition is assessed by doctors as moderate and mild,"" Golubev said. One witness said: ""We heard one clap, but strong, very strong. Glasses in nearby cafes flew out."" Another said: ""This is the site where something either struck from the air, or we don’t know. A huge crater, and everything around is destroyed, terrible, everything is destroyed, a car is under the rubble. “Something awful happened.” A second explosion occurred on the territory of the Kuibyshev oil refinery in Samara, State Duma deputy Alexander Khinshtein said on his Telegram channel. There were no casualties or serious damage, he said. The Kuibyshev Oil Refinery is one of the largest oil enterprises in the Samara Region, operating since 1945. It comes after Ukraine smashed through Russian frontlines in a huge tank assault as President Zelensky said his ""guys had very good results"".

"POLICE have launched an urgent hunt for an estate agent who vanished while showing a man around a home. Yanfei Bao, 44, disappeared on July 19 shortly after she was scheduled to meet a client at a property in Hornby, New Zealand . She was last seen in the suburbs where she was trying to sell the home of a couple who have relocated to Australia . The owners - who wished to remain anonymous - said they were ""shocked and stunned"" by the realtor's mysterious disappearance. Their home of nearly 40 years has now become a crime scene, with cops describing it as an area of ""significant interest"". The pad, which the couple say is due to undergo forensic examination, has become the focal point of the investigation. Yanfei was set to show someone around the place on Wednesday - the morning she vanished - according to the couple. The Christchurch realtor is feared to have been abducted from the property, although cops are now treating it as a murder inquiry. Residents have been warned to expect an increased police presence in the coming days as the quest for answers continues. Disturbingly, an open house was held at the property days after Yanfei had been reported missing. An auction for the pad that was scheduled for Wednesday has now been postponed as cops continue to probe the scene. The owners said: ""We just hope everything turns out all right."" An extensive search across Hornby remains underway, with authorities scouring the area both on foot and in helicopters. Teams have been focusing on the nearby Halswell River area around Lake Ellesmere at Greenpark in the hunt for clues. Dive squads have been using sonar technology to continue the search underwater, police said. The case has the same eerie hallmarks as that of missing Brit Suzy Lamplugh , who disappeared while showing a flat in London in 1986. Locals are holding out hope that Yanfei will still be found alive, despite police upgrading it to a murder investigation. Detective Inspector Nicola Reeves said the contents of the property was ""certainly one of the contributing factors"" to that decision. Yanfei's family, based in China, said her mother collapsed and has been ""crying since"" hearing the news. A 52-year-old man was arrested at Christchurch International Airport on Saturday on suspicion of kidnap, according to reports. The suspect, who had only been in New Zealand for a few months, was trying to board a one-way flight to China without any luggage. Police charged him with taking Yanfei without her consent and with intent to keep her confined. After appearing in court , a judge allowed for his name to remain anonymous on a temporary basis as he was remanded into custody. Officials instead directed the public to focus on possible sightings of both the suspect's and the estate agent's vehicles. The man was driving a silver Mitsubishi sedan with a DPH101 number plate and a distinctive yellow diamond sticker with a black kiwi on the boot. The force refused to say whether there was any evidence that Yanfei had been in the vehicle, but forensic tests are underway. Detectives are also working to determine how the missing realtor's car was moved to a different street on the day of her disappearance. Police reassured locals they are throwing all their resources at the case and want to ""bring her home safe and well."" In one of the UK's most notorious cold cases, estate agent Suzy Lamplugh , 25, vanished in Fulham in July 1986. She was due to show a ""Mr Kipper"" around an aparment on Shorrolds Road, but was never seen again. Witnesses had seen her with an ""extremely smart"" bloke with dark, swept back hair aged between 25-30 and wearing a dark suit. Suzy was officially pronounced dead and presumed murdered 30 years ago this month - but there are now hopes new technology could reveal fresh answers. Scotland Yard named convicted murderer, rapist and abductor John Cannan as the prime suspect in her disappearance in 2002.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yanfei-bao-worked-real-estate-834686792.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/car-looks-like-yanfei-bao-834686919.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ebb74bff-6d03-4642-9899-c6a07795e15c.jpg",Estate agent vanishes taking man to house viewing in Suzy Lamplugh-style mystery as cops hunt car & search lake,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23236549/estate-agent-vanishes-man-house-viewing-new-zealand/
"US spies are probing whether Covid was created by a Chinese military scientist before it leaked from a Wuhan lab, according to reports. Zhou Yusen, who worked for the People’s Liberation Army , filed a patent for a Covid vaccine before the pandemic was declared - and mysteriously died just weeks later. Zhou, 54, worked alongside researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - the lab at the centre of the storm over a possible lab leak . Witnesses claim Zhou was thrown to his death from the roof of the lab - but this hasn't been verified. Intelligence agencies reportedly suspect that the Chinese army was involved in his death. And in a new bombshell report, Sharri Markson , the author of What Really Happened in Wuhan, has revealed that the FBI has spoken to a close relative of Zhou at least twice in the last year. The individual, who now lives in the US, is understood to be a crucial new witness in the ongoing probe into the origins of Covid. The relative is said to be ""nervous"", according to Markson's report in The Weekend Australian . FBI director Christopher Wray has already publicly said Covid leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology . ""The FBI has assessed for quite some time that the origins… are a potential lab incident in Wuhan,"" Wray told Fox News in April. ""You’re talking about a potential leak from a Chinese government-controlled lab that killed millions of Americans."" Zhou reportedly ""worked closely"" with researchers at the Wuhan lab, including Shi Zhengli - dubbed ""batwoman"" for her extensive work on bat coronaviruses . And US investigators reportedly believe Zhou may have known of a lab leak long before it was probed as possibility. It was revealed in June 2021 that Zhou was the lead researcher on Chinese ­patent documents for a Covid vaccine. The patent was dated February 24, 2020 - and Zhou died about three months later. Vaccination experts said it would have been ""impossible"" to generate the data from Zhou's Covid patent unless he had been working on it for at least three months. Robert Kadlec, the former US assistant health secretary, said vaccine research might have sparked the pandemic. He told The Weekend Australian: ""We think vaccine research ­resulted in the pandemic, that vaccine ­research was the proximate cause. ""Animal-challenge studies used in vaccination are some of the highest-risk research that you can do with an infectious disease agent."" Dr Kadlec said Zhou might have been working with Ben Hu - who was named as the Wuhan researcher who fell sick with Covid-like symptoms in November 2019. He said the Wuhan ­Institute of Virology was ""likely working on a ­vaccine, it looks like they had a bio-containment failure... and that’s the period when Ben Hu and his colleagues fell sick, likely with Covid"". It comes after a secret memo revealed that China ordered scientists to destroy all early coronavirus samples from their labs just two days after the world was first told about Covid. As the pandemic was starting to explode across the world, panicked Beijing ordered the labs to share their samples with the government - or destroy them ""on the spot"", the leaked order shows. The memo - uncovered and translated by US Right to Know (USRTK) - exposes the Chinese government's far-reaching crackdown in the early days of the pandemic. Intelligence officials said the destruction of early samples hampered efforts to trace the virus' origin - and whether it leaked from a lab in Wuhan. The Chinese government order is dated January 3, 2020 - two days after the world was first made aware of the coronavirus spreading through China and the Huanan wet market was shut down. The memo ordered all early virus samples to be shared with high-level institutions designated by the government for testing - and then be destroyed. Any lab that obtained samples before January 3 was ordered to share them with the government or to destroy them ""on the spot"". Beijing vowed to ""strengthen law enforcement inspections"" and ""severely deal with"" anyone who ignored the order. Early samples are vital to piecing together the characteristics of Covid and how the pandemic began. But Chinese censorship and destruction of material has made it a challenging task for officials probing the origins of Covid. A mysterious dark database believed to include unpublished samples of data on new viruses and hidden bat samples was also taken offline by China. Both China and the Wuhan lab have furiously denied any allegations. But evidence of a lab leak has been piling up over the last two years as scientists, researchers and governments hunt for answers and step forward with evidence .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/security-personnel-keep-watch-outside-832824556.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wuhan-hubei-province-china-23-577372924.jpg","Covid was created by Chinese military scientist before Wuhan lab leak as US spies probe bombshell claims, says author",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23239857/covid-created-chinese-military-scientist-wuhan-lab-leak/
"PLANS to swap a Russian spy for wrongly-jailed journalist Evan Gershkovich have been blocked. A judge has refused a US request to extradite alleged spook Sergey Cherkasov , 37, who was jailed in Brazil last year. The White House hoped to trade him for the innocent Wall Street Journal reporter. Evan, 31, was snatched by secret police and thrown in a Moscow jail in March on trumped-up spying charges. US President Joe Biden said he was “serious” about a prisoner swap after the White House accused the Kremlin of sick “hostage diplomacy”. Cherkasov was unmasked as part of the GRU intelligence service last year after posing as a Brazilian citizen, Viktor Muller Ferreira, 33, for more than a decade. He was held in the Netherlands in June last year after jetting in on false papers to take up an internship at the International Criminal Court . Dutch intelligence claimed Cherkasov had tried to infiltrate the war crimes court, which later indicted President Vladimir Putin for abducting Ukrainian children. Cherkasov was sent back to Brazil where he was convicted of document fraud and jailed for 15 years, reduced to five on appeal. The US and Russia had both filed papers to extradite Cherkasov. Moscow claimed that he was wanted on drug-trafficking charges. The US charged him with spying and fraud. Evan was detained in Yekaterinburg on March 29, days after a US court unveiled the charges against Cherkasov. He faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted. His trial is due to start next month. Brazil’s Justice Ministry did not give reasons for refusing the US request. It suspended the Russian request.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wall-street-journal-reporter-evan-826845108.jpg,Deal to swap Russian spy for wrongly-jailed WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich blocked,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23240407/deal-swap-russian-spy-jailed-journalist-evan-gershkovich-blocked/
"A WOMAN who turned a cave into a tiny luxury home has revealed a surprising flaw. Louise Aqua shared a tour of the stunning home on TikTok - showing off a plush sitting room, full-sized bed and a cosy bathroom. She even kitted out her unusual home with a wine rack, potted plants and comfy chairs suspended from the rocky ceiling. But she revealed a surprising downside to living in the cave. One of the drawbacks to living inside a cave is the condensation and liquid which can creep in through the cracks - and the darkness. But Louise, from the Netherlands , said blinding sunshine still beams in - and sometimes it stops her from sleeping. Louise shared snippets of her life inside the cave - and TikTok users flooded the comment section of her videos with questions about her way of living. The most commonly asked questions was whether it got chilly inside the cave. One asked: ""It looks so cool! But, isn't cold in there? Louise replied: ""Nope."" Others asked if spiders were an issue - but Louise said: ""No, as long as you keep it clean."" Her followers were very impressed by the incredible transformation - with many saying it was their ""dream house"". One said: ""It's my hobbit dream coming trueeeee!"" Another wrote: ""Wow so beautiful."" A third commented: ""I want this right now!!!"" It comes after a former businessman quit his job and transformed an 800-year-old cave into his dream home after receiving a devastating diagnosis of MS. Angelo Mastropietro braved all the odds to turn the abandoned cave into a spectacular house - dubbed The Rockhouse Retreat. The unusual home was the first 21st century cave house retreat in Britain - and was sculpted 800 years ago before it was abandoned in 1960. Angelo spent £100,000 single-handedly remodelling the building - fitting the striking space with underfloor heating, running water and high-speed WiFi. Another couple turned a cave into their dream home after buying it for only £1. After being denied a loan from ten banks, Alexia Lamoreux and Lotte van Riel decided to work for three years to make the money needed to renovate the unique property. The couple bought their cave home, previously owned by his aunt, in France at auction for a bargain. Alexia and Lotte spent £30,000 on renovations - much cheaper than if the couple had decided to buy a traditional home.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6fa182e7-25e8-4c67-8617-732444bf9b3e.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0005d814-873d-4fe1-8d6b-9bd18fb2d235.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a77efde7-71d6-46f7-a92c-169ce53c6320.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/75f5e1bc-1d2d-41f9-b074-3137e67ba71e.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9f6ddec8-fe3c-46c8-9c8d-3f27f4bf239c.jpg",I transformed a cave into my luxury tiny home… but I’ve noticed a very surprising flaw,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23240844/cave-luxury-tiny-home-surprising-flaw/
"FOUR people are feared dead after a military helicopter smashed into the sea in Australia. The incident happened during Exercise Talisman Sabre - Australia’s largest joint military exercise with United States . The MRH 90 Taipan chopper crashed into the ocean off Hamilton Island in the Whitsundays with four people on board at about 11pm on Friday night. The wreckage of the Australian Defences Force aircraft was reportedly recovered south of Hamilton Island - but search and rescue teams are still searching for four passengers. Deputy prime minister Richard Marles said the chopper was taking part in a mission with another helicopter - which meant a search and rescue operation was launched immediately. ""The families of the four air crew have been notified of this incident and our hopes and our thoughts are very much with the air crew and their families,"" he said. ""These are early days and there will be much more information to be provided about this incident but defence exercises, which are so necessary for the readiness of our defence force, are serious. ""They carry risk and as we desperately hope for better news during the course of this day. ""We are reminded about the gravity of the act, which comes with wearing our nation's uniform."" According to reports, military aircraft are scouring the Airlie Beach area in far north Queensland. Launched in 2005, Talisman Sabre is a joint military exercise between Australia and the US. But it has expanded to 13 nations this year - involving 30,000 military personnel. The 14-day drills running until August 4 will test large scale logistics, land combat, amphibious landings and air operations.

"MILITARY emails meant for the Pentagon were sent to Russia’s ally Mali due to a typo. Staff dropped an “i” from the US military’s “.mil” address which routed them to the West African nation. Mali’s domain name ends “.ml”. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that up to 20 messages were sent in error. A spokesman said: “We have opened an investigation after a small number of emails were mistakenly forwarded to an incorrect email domain.” He said the emails were “not classified at secret or above”. The spokesman added: “We are confident they did not contain any information that could compromise operational security or technical data.” A defence source said MoD systems stop users sending secret information to unknown addresses. A similar blunder by US officials, meanwhile, saw thousands of emails go awry. Mali was one of a handful of countries to attend President Vladimir Putin’s Russia-Africa 2023 summit this week. Its military leader Colonel Assimi Goïta, who has twice seized power in a coup, had earlier welcomed Russia’s Wagner Group fighters to prop up his fragile regime. In response, Britain withdrew its 250 troops who formed a long-range desert reconnaissance group for a UN peacekeeping mission. They disrupted local terror gangs and were fired on by a Malian air force helicopter. The rocket came dangerously close, it was said, but no one was hurt. It came as Wagner stepped up its training of local forces.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7542a46e-5171-4be8-958c-457a800e8a41.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/345-million-military-aid-taiwan-834751566.jpg",Ministry of Defence sends military emails meant for US Pentagon to Russia’s ally Mali in blunder,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23241672/military-emails-us-pentagon-sent-russia-ally-mali/

"VLADIMIR Putin's 20-year iron fist reign will be over within a year, a former MI6 spy claimed. Christopher Steele, who ran MI6's Russia desk between 2006 and 2009, said the West needs to ""prepare for the end of the Putin era"". After two decades in power, Putin's once unquestionable control of Russia appears to be over following the Wagner rebellion and the disastrous Ukraine war. After the extraordinary mutiny from Yevgeny Prigozhin, experts have warned that the Kremlin's ""poisonous spiders"" were out for blood. Laying out possible scenarios, Steele suggested the tyrant could be assassinated by internal rebels - or by a plot from outside of Russia. He told Sky News this would be the worst scenario for the West as ""all bets would be off"" - with likely ""bloodshed"". But Steele also pointed to ""very credible sources telling us he's been ill for some time"" - suggesting Putin could die suddenly from illness. The leader could be ousted by an armed rebellion, or even decide it's time to go and step down at the next election in March 2024, Steele added. But he explained that the most likely ending for Putin will be ""violent"" move to kill or topple him. ""A move is made violently, if necessary, to kill or topple Putin in favour of another securocrat or regime oligarch,"" Steele said. ""But [it will be] one who has distanced themselves from the war and is prepared to negotiate on ending it genuinely with the West."" And the former spy revealed FSB director Alexander Bortnikov could be one of the frontrunners to take power from Putin, Steele said. He said ""rising star"" Aleksey Dyumin, the governor of Tula oblast, is another potential successor, along with oligarch Igor Sechin and former Russian prime minister Viktor Zubkov. Bortnikov is the current director of Russia’s FSB - making him one of the most powerful people in Russia and as an influential member of Putin’s inner circle. Like Putin, he is a former officer of the KGB and first met Putin while the pair were stationed together in Leningrad - now Saint Petersburg - in the 1970s. Since stepping into the mighty role in 2008, the terrifying spymaster is said to have turned the FSB into the “punishing sword” of Putin’s regime. The organisation is both the brain and the heart of Putin's government and behaves like a “state within the state"", according to the Dossier Center. Not long after Putin was appointed acting president, Bortnikov was first made head of Russia's Economic Security Service, wielding huge power and leverage. He is also one of a small handful of people in Russia to earn the rank of Army General. And in 2006, it was claimed that Bortnikov was involved in the operation to assassinate Alexander Litvinenko. But Steele said Putin could choose to back Dmitry Patrushev, son of the Russian Security Council secretary, or Aleksey Dyumin as the next leader of Russia. And he warned that this would mean ""little or no change to the war in Ukraine "". ""But at least the West would be facing a Russian leader who has not proven to be untrustworthy, a liar, and is not indicted for war crimes,"" Steele added. Steele said: ""I think there is real disquiet amongst key people in the leadership now. ""Not just in the armed forces where the generals have been openly criticising Putin and the Kremlin for its support for the war - which is unheard of - but more generally the idea of the trajectory of Russia now: led by a president who's been indicted for war crimes, who's leading the Russian economy down a certain path."" Steven L. Hall, a former Russian CIA intelligence lead, said the Russian military elite pose a ""real threat"" to Putin. ""Men like Patrushev and Bortnikov not only possess hard power, but they know how to use it and are inclined to do so,” he told The Washington Post last year. ""The siloviki are willing to use this deadly mixture of hard power and secrecy when a serious threat to the Russian kleptocratic system emerges."" Russian siloviki translates to ""people of force"" or ""strong men"" - the term given to former military personnel who are now in political positions. Mr Hall added: ""They have weapons and the personnel to threaten Putin. “They know how to operate under Putin’s radar, because they are the ones in charge of the radar itself. ""And while it is reasonable to assume Putin has some means to monitor the siloviki, he will not be able to follow their actions constantly and with great precision, given all the other issues on his plate.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/defence-minister-sergei-shoigu-l-254879209.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2016-brexit-referendum-laid-extent-598090094.jpg","Putin will be gone within a year and the West MUST be ready for his terrifying replacement, warns ex-MI6 spy",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23242070/putin-gone-within-year-terrifying-replacement-spy/
"FOUR people have been electrocuted to death after their religious float hit overhead cables during a procession. Another 10 people were also injured during the Muharram procession in Jharkhand's Bokaro district, India . The group's religious float, made of iron, came in contact with a live wire carrying 11,000 volts, police confirmed. Footage showed members of the procession coming down the street, when an electric shock sound was heard and a few men started falling to the ground. A man in the procession warned the others to stop as he apparently saw the float coming way too close to the live wire. ""Stop, stop, stop,"" he shouted in Hindi. However, as soon as people came in touch with the live wire, the blast took place. ""Didn't I warn you to stop,"" the man repeated in his shrill voice. ""The incident occurred around 6am on Saturday while they were preparing for a Muharram procession,"" Bokaro Superintendent of Police Priyadarshi Alok said. All injured people have been taken to a nearby hospital. Eight of them were referred to the Bokaro General Hospital, where four succumbed to their injuries and three were stated to be in critical condition, the officer added. The Mourning of Muharram, also known as the Muharram procession or observances, is a set of commemoration rituals observed primarily by Shia Muslims. The commemoration falls in Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar. Earlier this year, at least 35 worshippers were killed after plunging into a deep well as a makeshift floor collapsed at a temple in India. Emergency services raced to the scene in Indore after the floor caved in while more than 40 people were performing a fire ritual to celebrate a Hindu festival. At least 35 people, mostly women and children, have died. The army was called in at 11pm as the desperate rescue operation continued into the night.

"PERCHED by the glistening waters of Croatia sit the sinister-looking ruins of a luxury hotel complex that was once bustling with tourists. But the resort now provides an eerie backdrop for sunbathers and even films as its bullet-riddled walls crumble and hold nothing more than debris and graffiti. Scarred by Croatia's war history , the ghostly complex is in Kupari village - just a stone's throw from Dubrovnik's busy beaches. But as well as being gawped at by tourists, the ruins have been used for filming of the upcoming biopic Lee, about renowned World War 2 Vogue journalist Lee Miller. According to local reports, it was one of several locations in Croatia Kate Winslet and Jude Law shot scenes last September. With the Grand Hotel as its crowning jewel, the site features several other hotels - Pelegrin, Goricine I, Goricine II, Kupari and Galeb - able to accommodate thousands of guests. The Grand Hotel flung its doors open in 1919 after a forward-thinking Czech investor realised the area's tourism potential. From the 1960s to the 1980s, several other hotels popped around it - largely bankrolled by the military. It then became a huge draw for the Yugoslav military elite and their families - and Yugoslavian leader Josip Broz Tito even had his private villa there. Spots at the hotel became harder and harder for normal holidaymakers to snap up - with rooms often prioritised for those with military connections. But when the Balkans conflict kicked off in the 1990s, the Yugoslav People's Army dramatically bombed their own precious holiday project in a bid to push out the Croatian soldiers. They then badly vandalised the once-plush hotels, igniting phosphorous bombs and looting the rooms. Following the destruction, Croatia's army used the complex as a base before it was abandoned for good as the new millennium dawned. The few remaining relics were then stripped out by locals, and the site has stood empty ever since and never returned to its former glory. Once a revolving door for high-ranking officers, its only visitors now are curious explorers. But there remains hope for the stagnating site as it sits on prime tourism turf, with many investors and developers understood to be eager to snap up the plot. In recent months, it has been reported a contract has been signed by Kupari Luxury Hotels to renovate the site, now nicknamed the ""bay of abandoned hotels"". It is understood the Grand Hotel would be kept as the centrepiece, but the other hotels demolished to make way for new constructions. Minister of State Property, Branko Bacic, told Poslovni : ""According to the plan of the District of Dubrovnik, a period of 12 months is prescribed during which the investor is obliged to obtain a valid building permit, and within a further period of four years to realise the project.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/shutterstock-id-572882710-824957410.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/p3yy3h-bombed-derelict-hotels-resort-824968471.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/adriatic-sea-seen-abandoned-hotel-824957394.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abandoned-hotels-kupari-829493022.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/adriatic-sea-seen-abandoned-hotel-824957409.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abandoned-hotels-kupari-829493169-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/graffiti-wall-hotel-abandoned-yugoslavian-829493170.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/graphite-wall-devastated-coffee-shop-824968490.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/abandoned-dirty-demolished-building-one-824957959.jpg",Inside the bullet-riddled ‘bay of abandoned hotels’ where stars Kate Winslet and Jude Law shot upcoming WW2 film,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/22691667/bay-of-abandoned-hotels-kate-winslet-jude-law-film/
"A MOTHER was stunned to find out she had become a multi-millionaire after she discovered a $2 million lotto ticket stuck to her fridge. The Sydney woman had the jackpot ticket for weeks since the multi-million dollar draw on June 24. After returning the winning ticket, the mum said she would now be able to pay off her mortgage and help set her children up for life. “I just want our children to grow up safe and happy and this just puts everything into perspective,” she told The Lott. “For us being able to pay off the mortgage is huge. “I just can‘t picture that we can just pay off the mortgage. “It would have taken us such a long time. It will be such a relief.” The woman added she “hadn’t stopped sweating” since discovering she would become a multi-millionaire. “I’m just going around my house thinking, ‘what do I do, what do I do’,” she said. “I don’t know what to do. I’m dying right now. I’m just so excited. I feel sick. “This ticket has been on our fridge the whole time. I’m the one who bought the ticket from Leppington Newsagency. “Every time I shop there, I just kept thinking: ‘you’re going to make me a winner’. And they have. I can’t believe it.” Leppington Newsagency owners Pradeep and Mini Ahluwalia said they were thrilled about the mum’s shock win. “Congratulations and best wishes to our winner for their mega win,” Pradeep said. “In the past two years, we have sold five division one or major jackpot prizes. “We hope this trend will continue for all our loyal customers.” Earlier this week, Australia's luckiest lottery suburbs have been revealed as the latest Powerball jackpot goes up for grabs. New data revealed some Aussie suburbs are luckier than others when it comes to winning big. While the last Powerball winner was a lucky Bankstown dad who scored the whopping $100 million, Victoria has actually had the most division one winners of the past year. Nobody has claimed this week's $60 million jackpot yet. However, if it goes to another New South Wales resident, there is a strong chance they could be from Sydney's west.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lottery-ticket-forms-arranged-display-833939049.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woman-buys-lottery-ticket-new-716354729.jpg",I had no idea I’d scooped $2million lottery jackpot – I was stunned by my reaction to becoming a multi-millionaire,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23243007/i-had-no-idea-id-scooped-2million-lottery-jackpot/

Yuriby is the niece of model and influencer Kimberly Flores, who boasts a whopping 2.5million Instagram followers. The heartbroken blogger shared an emotive tribute describing her ""indescribable"" pain after losing her beloved sidekick. Kimberly said: ""I can't cope with so much pain. ""We were always together in a single heartbeat, my love. You had so many dreams."" She shared a sweet photo from her wedding day four years ago, showing Yuriby proudly watching her aunt walk down the aisle. Kimberly continued: ""How can it be that four years ago was the happiest and most special day of my life? ""And today can possibly be the saddest. This pain is indescribable."" The 36-year-old's husband, Mexican singer Edwin Luna, also posted a solemn tribute on social media. He wrote: ""May the whole family find comfort in shared memories and in the love that will always be present. RIP Yuriby Gómez.""

"EIGHT people have been killed after a horror explosion at a firecracker warehouse in India. Another 12 people sustained burn injuries following the blast, which took place in Tamil Nadu 's Krishnagiri town on Saturday morning. Seven of the eight deceased have been identified as cracker shop owner Ravi, his wife Jayashree, their daughter Rithika, their son Rithish, a hotel shop owner named Rajeswari and their neighbours Ibarahim and Imran. The accident happened at around 9.45am when the firecrackers stored at the warehouse started to blast one by one, The Times of India reports. ""Fire spread to the cracker shop and other shops, including a hotel, and nearby houses,"" said Krishnagiri district collector K M Sarayu. She said that a shop and three houses collapsed, with residents trapped under the debris. The exact number of people trapped is has not been confirmed yet. Fire brigades and police carried out rescue operations and doused the blaze. The injured, including two in critical condition, were admitted to Government Hospital in Krishnagiri. Local investigation indicates that the firework godown had been operational since 2020 and was regularly renovated by the owner every year.

"SALT Bae's New York restaurant has been hit with four lawsuits from disgruntled staff and customers in a major blow to his empire, The Sun can reveal. The flamboyant Turk is renowned for his trademark sprinkle of salt on ridiculously priced gold-covered steaks - with more than 20 restaurants around the world. But Salt Bae's glam restaurants have been hit with several lawsuits - accused of siphoning off tips , sexual and racial discrimination, and breaking employment law. And the Nusr-Et Midtwon steakhouse, owned by the showman whose real name is Nusret Gökçe, has faced four lawsuits - which have previously gone unreported. Three of the cases have been resolved, while the fourth is ongoing. Bathroom attendant Cattysha Flores worked at Nusr-Et Midtown steakhouse from May 2019 and filed her lawsuit in July 2021. She claims the policy for staff was ""no complaining about customers"" despite once being asked by a male customer ""to show her feet"". She was allegedly told to comply with this as he was ""known to give a $100 tip to other female employees when they complied"". Flores was also allegedly accosted by a drunk customer, who ""grabbed her"" by the left arm, and demanded: ""Kiss me, kiss me, why don’t you kiss me?"" Instead of being backed up by the general manager, he supposedly gave a ""high five"" to the customer and told Flores: ""Oh, he’s just drunk."" Flores claims that she called the cops twice regarding the incident and the ""same customer [had] harassed other female employees"". But she allegedly told that Nusret management had told them it was “not a big deal”. Gökçe was allegedly at the restaurant when all this happened ""but took no remedial action to address the situation"", which ""condoned"" his management’s behaviour. Flores also claimed that her manager asked a fellow cleaner why “his people” wear “those things on their heads"" - meaning a Durag hat. The restaurant's lawyers denied the allegations in court documents. The suit was forced into arbitration last year by a judge and then discontinued in April. The company has been successful in moving virtually all ex-worker lawsuits against them into mediation. They state they all signed similar agreements that ""any claims that employee may have or had against employer, or any of its officers, directors, supervisors, managers, employees, or agents"" will be arbitrated. But a lawsuit that’s still going through the courts was filed in August last year by Palestinian-born Taher Ali - who was hired as the general manager at the NY Midtown restaurant in September 2018. He claims to have been discriminated against as he was the only non-Turkish manager and frequently had to work longer hours than other managers with no breaks and told “you are not one of us”. Ali wasn’t allowed to meet Gökçe ""because he doesn’t know a Palestinian is running the restaurant"", according to court documents. He also alleges Turkish staff received a larger cut of the tip pool and non-Turks were often ignored. When Ali brought up other staff grievances, he was allegedly told by his manager that ""if they want to understand what we are saying, they can learn Turkish"". He was demoted to ""food runner"" before being sacked ""because he was not one of us” and ""cares too much about the Americans and we are here to make money"", the lawsuit adds. The company denied all of the claims against it. At the same restaurant, customer Grecy Ramos filed a lawsuit, also in August 2022, accusing a server of spilling “scalding hot water onto the body of Plaintiff causing significant burns”. The lawsuit said Ramos was seeking damages due to ""sustained serious, severe and permanent personal injuries"". In court documents, Nusret Steakhouse's lawyers, Sjoquist & Baer denied the allegations. The case was discontinued in July last year for unknown reasons. In another unreported case, blind customer Windy Lucius reached a settlement after suing in the Florida federal court alleging that the website was not accessible to the blind and violated the disabilities act. Court documents said Lucius had reached an agreement to resolve the claims. Meanwhile, the restaurant has ongoing lawsuits with former Nusr-et Steakhouse New York staffers Elizabeth Cruz and Angelo Maher, who both filed suits in November 2021. Bartender Cruz said she was humiliated when a manager ordered her to change into a ""short skirt, high-heels, and revealing top"" on her first day. Latino waiter Maher claimed in another lawsuit he was called ""Spanish s***"" by a colleague and the steakhouse was a place of ""physical intimidation and discriminatory intimidation directed at non-Turkish employees”. The restaurant denied the claims. He also claimed he was made to lie to customers that the meat was halal - permitted in Islam - ""despite the fact this was not true"". Their lawsuits are ongoing. A Nusr-Et spokesperson told The Sun: ""The majority of the cases are closed and we cannot comment on cases that have been settled. ""Only one of the cases are active and we do not comment on pending litigation."" It comes after Salt Bae closed down his Salt Bae Burger joint in New York, dubbed ""the worst restaurant"" in the city. It relocated to the same address as the chain of Nusr-Et Steakhouses in New York. The restaurant charged $99 for a gold-flecked milkshake, $100 for a gold burger and sparked outrage for offering a free veggie “ladies burger” in a pink bun to women only. The Sun can reveal that the 39-year-old has climbed down from his obscene prices after hundreds of bad reviews and now offers a $39 three-course lunchtime menu at all seven of his US branches.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/salt-baes-nusret-g-k-495695172.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/salt-baes-nusret-g-k-495697189.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/customers-dine-nusr-ets-outdoor-833199888.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-instagram-com-nusretnewyorkcity-hl-833202914.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/39756887-4f25-450c-b768-d8f449c3ff47.jpg",Salt Bae waitress ‘forced to show diner her bare feet’ as celeb chef’s New York restaurant hit with FOUR lawsuits,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23126525/salt-bae-four-lawsuits-empire-closing-worst-restaurant/
"A FURIOUS tenant was branded a ""Karen"" after their furious letter to ""brain dead morons"" over sorting of rubbish into bins. The blunt note to other residents at an apartment building in Bondi, Australia , slammed their failure to put the correct items in rubbish bins. ""To all the brain dead morons in this building,"" it began before explaining what sort of rubbish should be placed into each colour-coded bin. ""Yellow - plastic, glass, empty cans. ""Blue - paper. ""Red - rest of rubbish. ""So please behave or f*** off home to your mother to look after you!!!"" Karen is a pejorative term used as slang for a middle-class white woman who is perceived as entitled or demanding beyond the scope of what is normal. The term is often portrayed in memes depicting middle-class white women who ""use their white and class privilege to demand their own way"". The note was found by a neighbour, who shared a photo of it to the local community Facebook page. ""Who's the Karen who left this note in my building?"" they wrote. The post caught the attention of hundreds of locals who had mixed views on the letter's abrupt wording. Some thought the letter writer was too aggressive and said being ""rude"" was not the way to solve the issue. ""Joizus. This guy needs a hug or a joint!"" one commented. ""Put the note in the blue bin, obviously,"" another replied. While a third said: ""Someone is off their meds"". But others agreed with the angry Karen, saying they would they would like a similar sign put up where they live. ""I'm with Karen on this one,"" one wrote. ""Place this on every unit block,"" another said. A third added: ""And flatten cardboard boxes before throwing them in the bin."" ""To be fair someone needs to say it, it makes lives easier if people did things right first time,"" a fourth replied. Waverley Council operates a four-bin kerbside waste and recycling collection service for local households. It collects waste to landfill, comingled containers, paper and cardboard, and garden waste. Waverly Council's website warns that putting the wrong items in the yellow lid bin can result in the bin contents going to landfill instead of being recycled. It urges people to not put household garbage, plastic bags, non-recyclable glass, electronics or clothing into the yellow lid recycling bin.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/everyone-agrees-834876757.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/australian-garbage-wheelie-bins-colourful-746922648.jpg",Neighbour branded a ‘Karen’ over note to ‘brain dead morons’ putting rubbish in wrong bin – but not everyone agrees,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23243413/australia-karen-rubbish-bins-furious-letter/
"ART fans have been left baffled by a 400-year-old painting of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost - that appears to include a Russian satellite. Ventura Salimbeni created the Glorification of the Eucharist in 1595, but some conspiracy theorists claim it includes modern technology . Barmy social media users believe the Italian artist somehow travelled hundreds of years into the future - and added a clue in his work. Some people claim to have spotted Russia 's Sputnik-1 satellite lurking in the background of the painting, despite it being launched in 1957. Honing in on a spiky blue sphere, conspiracy theorists say it eerily resembles the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth . Despite the claims initially being laughed off, even experts have admitted the pair look ""surprisingly similar"". Steve Mera, chairman of the Manchester Association of Paranormal Investigation & Training (MAPIT), said: ""You start to find a lot of religious connotation linked in with the UFO phenomenon. ""This painting was painted in the 1600s and nobody ever really knew what that was a painting of, until we kind of looked at Sputnik."" He told Indy100 it had even left him questioning if people ""somehow had knowledge of future events."" Steve continued: ""What is really, really interesting is it is surprisingly similar to Sputnik, even to the point there is a little nodule there (on Sputnik) and the exact same nodule on the side there (on the object in the painting)."" But religious buffs insist the detailed sphere was simply a symbol of the ""Creation Globe"" that is seen in many paintings of the Holy Trinity. It was suggested that Salimbeni had combined elements of the Sun and the Moon in his illustration of it. This is not the first time modern gadgets have been spotted in historic paintings either. Conspiracy theorists claimed to have spotted a woman with her eyes glued to an iPhone in Ferdinand George Waldmüller's work. Although it was published two centuries before smartphones entered our lives, it left many people scratching their heads. Even former Apple boss Tim Cook has been stumped by a similar incident after visiting a museum in Amsterdam in 2016. He claimed to have noticed an iPhone in a 350-year-old piece of artwork hanging on the wall. Cook earlier told a conference: ""I always thought I knew when the iPhone was invented, but now I'm not so sure anymore.""

"CADBURY has launched a new chocolate bar inspired by a beloved Aussie bakery treat, and it's flying off the shelves. The Vanilla Passionfruit Dairy Milk Bar is the latest addition to Cadbury's SLICES range, currently only available in Australia . The new flavour comes after the chocolate giant announced in April that a whole new range would join the Dairy Milk Crackle, Caramilk Hedgehog and Cadbury Old Gold Mint Creme on grocery store shelves. The Vanilla Passionfruit SLICES bar is a creamy, yet tangy, twist on regular old chocolate. A passion fruit-flavoured jelly at the very core is wrapped with a vanilla cream, covered with the traditional Cadbury dairy milk chocolate. It is inspired by the beloved passion fruit slice you'd see in any good Aussie bakery, which has a coconut crust and a creamy layer of passion fruit, lemon and sweetened condensed milk. This new SLICES flavour is now available at leading retailers across Australia for $5.50. But some chocolate fans are struggling to get their hands on the sweet treat. ""I want to try this but I can't seem to find it in the aisles yet in Brisbane,"" one said. ""I could not for the life of me find it in stock at Coles,"" another replied. The lucky ones who manage to get it, have given mixed reviews. Emily, who goes under @snackreviews_aus on TikTok , shared her thoughts to her followers saying she couldn't taste the vanilla as much. ""It had a nice passion fruit flavour, but the vanilla kind of got a bit lost,"" she said. ""If this was made with a Caramilk chocolate base, this would have been way better as well. ""But I still recommend to give this block a try."" TikTok user Zach also shared his thoughts, saying the new Cadbury bar was more like a dessert than a quick snack. He said: ""Can't really taste the vanilla but you can taste the passion fruit straight out."" But another reviewer, who goes by The Douquet , had a completely different opinion saying the chocolate had the ""perfect ratio"" of passion fruit and vanilla. ""You can smell the passion fruit straight away,"" she said as she opened the chocolate bar. ""Oh my God, yum. That is amazing. I have no words. ""This block of chocolate has the perfect passion fruit to vanilla ratio."" The Sun Online has asked Mondelēz if and when the Vanilla Passionfruit SLICES bar will be available in the UK. A spokesperson for the company said: “While we don’t have any plans to launch the new Cadbury Dairy Milk Vanilla Passionfruit SLICES bar in the UK at the moment, we’re always listening to our fans to ensure our range of products reflects their changing tastebuds, whilst also including their favourites.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/getting-fruity-cadbury-launches-new-834893107.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/508f2caa-8389-4512-98be-35d9e7aca1f2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/getting-fruity-cadbury-launches-new-834892845.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/getting-fruity-cadbury-launches-new-834893109.jpg",Cadbury launches new chocolate bar inspired by beloved Aussie bakery treat – and it’s flying off the shelves,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23244602/cadbury-new-chocolate-bar-aussie-bakery-treat/
"RUSSIAN doctors are in despair as Vladimir Putin's troops fighting in Ukraine are returning home as ""aggressive zombies"". Soldiers - many of them mobilised against their will - are behaving like "" animals "" after being psychologically warped by the horrors they have experienced. Many have turned to drink and drugs to cope with the memories of brutality and merciless cruelty, a shocking new report says. But they are bringing the horrors of the frontline to their own doorsteps, as they have returned with a chilling thirst for violence. A senior health official who is treating a legion of disturbed Russians warned: ""Aggressive zombies will soon fill the streets of our cities."" The doctor told news outlet Novaya Vkladka: ""They will massively beat and even kill passers-by. ""And how to prevent it, I personally do not know. ""I just do not see other scenarios for the development of the situation with those who returned from the special military operation."" The calamitous human cost of Putin's war has stoked fears that Russia will face a ""cheap zombie apocalypse "" - fuelled by booze and drugs. More than a quarter of a million troops have been killed or physically maimed in the brutal war since it began 18 months ago. But those who make it home alive are returning to a different kind of warzone altogether. The anonymous health official said he is surrounded by ""wounded, amputees, drug addicts, alcoholics, [and] people with mental and psychological problems."" Despite working in Kemerovo, a Siberian region four times zones east of the war, he says it has been overwhelmed by traumatised troops. ""Injuries, PTSD - this is all, of course, a problem, it needs to be dealt with, but the main, in my opinion, problem in terms of prevalence and potential danger is addictions,"" he said. ""Simply put, a lot of those who returned [from the war] are either alcoholics or, more often, drug addicts."" World War II troops infamously went into battle drugged up to their eyeballs on methamphetamines in the hopes of being more alert. It has been claimed that Adolf Hitler himself was a ""super-junkie"" , who was routinely injected with cocaine and a heroin-like opiate . The medic said available doctors in Russia are each expected to handle between 200 and 250 unhinged war returnees each month. He claimed the main substances being abused by fighters are amphetamines, including speed. ""And here everything is much more complicated and sadder in terms of the prospects for treatment and subsequent socialisation."" Chilling footage showed several soldiers in a trance-like state while being awarded bravery medals for their role in the invasion. The wounded troops sat silently in a row of wheelchairs with disturbingly blank expressions while deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin hailed their war efforts in March. Some demoralised and disillusioned soldiers have fled the frontline in tears or surrendered without a fight to escape the savagery. The doctor revealed ""almost every other person"" returning from Putin 's bloody war admits to the use of psycho-stimulants. He described the fight against the crisis as ""hopeless"" due to a huge shortage of doctors, with many medics leaving due to the intolerable pressures. ""This special military operation [war] is like another tombstone on the grave. There are almost no doctors left,"" the health chief said. A large portion of Russian doctors are being forced to work in the war zone in occupied Ukraine , or face losing their jobs . Under an order from the health ministry, neuropathologists are each expected to take on 300 war returnees a month on top of their existing caseloads, said another medic. He told how a stormtrooper in the notorious Wagner mercenary army had become hellbent on inflicting violence. ""He had never beaten [his wife] before,"" the doctor explained.

"CAN you spot the three snakes hidden among the leaves in the picture below? The snakes in the picture are eastern copperheads, a venomous species of pit viper found across eastern parts of North America , and are masters of camouflage. Copperheads have a distinctive hourglass pattern on their scales. which, combined with their brown coloration, makes for extremely effective camouflage. This enables them to blend in with their surroundings and means they are very difficult to spot among fallen leaves, for instance. They can grow to around 22 to 36 inches as adults, the Florida Museum of Natural History explained. The picture was shot by Bonnie Keller, who works with wildflife company K2C Wildlife Encounters, in Virginia . ""I had just released them, so I knew where they were,"" Bonnie told Newsweek . ""But it was amazing how easily they blended in, so I took the picture. ""Evolution has favoured this coloration to protect them from predators such as foxes, birds of prey, etcetera,"" she said. Bonnie's picture was shared by K2C on Facebook , leaving viewers shocked when they actually find them. ""Look what happens when you have copperheads in leaves..... magic, they disappear!!"" the post read. ""Fortunately, copperheads tend to stay in places with more cover, but be vigilant!"" One user revealed she had ""learned the hard way"" how effective copperhead camouflage can be when her puppy was bitten by one of the snakes. ""Bonnie helped relocate the copperhead hanging out in the front yard by our bushes where there was mulch and leaves, and since then we have kept our yard a bit more organized and hopefully not as hospitable to snakes,"" another commented. Have you managed to spot them? If not, don't worry as Bonnie outlined their locations in the edited image below.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocked-find-https-www-facebook-834920541.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocked-find-https-www-facebook-834922196.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shocked-find-https-www-facebook-834920654.jpg",Can you spot the snakes camouflaged among the leaves – you might be surprised by what you ACTUALLY find,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23245240/can-you-spot-the-snakes-camouflaged-among-the-leaves/
"AT LEAST nine people have been killed after a fireworks warehouse exploded in Thailand. The fatal disaster erupted near the Malaysian border this afternoon -  flattening nearby homes and leaving 118 bystanders injured. The devastating blast happened in the southern province Narathiwat at about 3pm. Officials said at least 118 people were wounded and more than 200 households have been affected. Shocking footage from the wreckage site showed the small town laid to waste. All that appeared left of the levelled area was infrastructure scrappage as devastated residents looked on in horror. Aerial drone footage captured thick smoke billowing out of nearby buildings and fires raging as emergency crews attended the scene. According to local reports, the blast was believed to have been caused by construction work. Sanon Pongaksorn, the local governor, claimed preliminary investigations indicated a ""technical error"" in the steel welding of one of the buildings. At the time, residents reportedly heard a huge explosion, which then shook surrounding buildings. What followed was the shattering of windows, collapsed-in rooves and a massive plume of smoke into the air, the BBC reports. Cops confirmed nine people have died as a result of the blast. Seksan Taesen, an eyewitness who lives 330ft from the market area, told AFP it was terrifying. He said: ""Loud, thunderous noise and my whole house shook. ""Then I saw my roof was wide open. ""I looked outside and I saw house collapsing and people lying on the ground everywhere. ""It was chaos."" It comes after eight people were killed in another firecracker warehouse explosion on the same day .

"BRITISH tourists who fled the Rhodes wildfires are to be offered trauma counselling — as islanders battle to reopen hotels. Under-fire tour operator TUI — which was accused of abandoning its customers when the blazes broke out — is offering free, confidential therapy. Bosses have emailed customers to tell them they can get support from the Centre for Crisis Psychology. It provided counselling to survivors of the Tunisia beach massacre in 2015, in which 30 Brits were shot dead by a gunman. Its experts were also drafted in to help witnesses to the 2017 Manchester Arena terror attack when 22 died and more than 1,000 were hurt. The email said the advice — following an “extraordinary difficult” and “distressing” few days — was “there for you to call upon”. Hundreds of Brits were among the 19,000 who fled their resorts as the fires approached in what was the biggest evacuation in Greek history . Workmen were toiling flat-out yesterday to restore power lines, while hotel staff were using pressure washers to clean the deep film of ash off tables and chairs. Burnt timbers and the twisted metal remains were removed at the Princess Andriana Resort & Spa at Kiotari. Restaurant owner Sevi ­Petalas, 38, said: “Rhodes is safe. Our people need you to come. “I understand that it is difficult for people to come and see ash and black trees but the sea is still blue.” Yet British officials on the ground warned ash had fallen into reservoirs, affecting water supplies. TUI , meanwhile, is offering full refunds and a £250 voucher per person towards a future holiday with the firm. A spokesman said the blazes were out of its control. Fuming June Jeremy, 68, of Cardiff , said: “The £250 vouchers don’t come near to making up for the stress and pain we went through.” Mum-of-two Jess Bailey, 50, of Ottery Saint Mary, Devon , added: “Heads should roll. There’s been a complete dereliction of duty. “There are so many questions that still remain unanswered and it’s high time they gave the answers.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-834797931.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/across-parts-country-tuesday-following-834056264.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-834888672.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-834886545.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rhodes-wild-fire-fires-rage-834887825.jpg",British tourists who fled Rhodes wildfires to be offered trauma counselling as locals battle to reopen hotels,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23246171/british-tourists-fled-rhodes-wildfires-trauma-counselling/
"JAILED sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell fears she has lost millions in property and jewels. The shamed Brit socialite’s former £4.5million mansion has been sold. And she does not know the whereabouts of her million dollar jewellery collection. Maxwell , 61, serving 20 years, now faces representing herself in her appeal against her conviction as she cannot afford lawyers . Sources close to her say the US beachfront property was bought in 2016 with her money but held in the name of her former hubby Scott Borgerson. But he has always insisted his ex has no ownership stake in the house, which was purchased by a limited company under his control. Maxwell and the 47-year-old tech millionaire divorced earlier this month. An insider said: “There is not a penny left. There’s nothing to pay any lawyers. She feels Scott has left her high and dry. “Now she is facing her appeal with limited funds.” The sale of the house in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts ,  went through last Wednesday. Maxwell is also said to fear expensive kitchen equipment has been damaged or disappeared. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 of luring girls for paedo tycoon Jeffrey Epstein . He was found dead in jail in 2019 before his sex trafficking trial. Earlier tonight, Scott told The Sun on Sunday: “Your facts are false.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ghislaine_Maxwelljpg-JS768178311.jpg,Ghislaine Maxwell fears she’s been left penniless as ex-husband sells £4.5 million home,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23247362/ghislaine-maxwell-fears-penniless-ex-husband-sells-home/
"UKRAINE could soon begin attempts to take back Russian-occupied Crimea, the country’s intelligence chief says. Kyrylo Budanov told a news website that ­forces could enter the peninsula to “de-occupy” it shortly — but offered no firm time frame. It came just a week after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Kerch Bridge linking the territory to Russia was a “legitimate” target. The bridge has been bombed to disrupt arms supplies to Vladimir Putin’s forces. Crimea has been under Russian occupation since 2014 and Ukraine has repeatedly stressed that re-taking it is a key part of its counter-offensive. Mr Zelensky, meanwhile, said he had visited hotspot city Bakhmut to “congratulate” his country’s “warrior” special forces as Kyiv ramps up its fightback. He said the crack unit recently helped to recapture the village of Staromaiorske. Mr Zelensky added: “The guys inflict especially tangible blows on Russian terrorists.” Earlier, two teenage children were among nine victims hurt by a Russian missile strike that hit a tower block’s top floor in Dnipro in eastern Ukraine . Officials said the condition of the pair was not life-threatening. But Mr Zelensky branded the attack “Russian missile terror”. He also posted a video showing smoke rising from buildings. Ukraine’s counter-offensive continued to gather pace yesterday as  commanders revealed North Korean rockets captured from Russian forces were now being used against the enemy. They were said to have been seized from a “friendly” country before delivery to Ukraine, the Financial Times reported. Military experts predict battlefield triumphs in the days to come.

"THIS is the terrifying moment a man was frozen with fear after a venomous 7ft king cobra slithered inside his shirt. The chilling incident reportedly happened in India when the gardener decided to have quick kip after lunch. Frightening footage showed the deadly snake crawling into the man's top. It then popped its venomous head out for a gander before darting back inside after being spooked by horrified bystanders. The panicked worker appears to raise his arms in the air away from danger as he awaited instructions. A fellow worker said: ""Stay quiet and don’t move. ""How has this gone inside… don’t shout it will bite."" While another colleague is heard advising: ""Don’t move your hands, it’s an enraged snake and it can bite you."" The man replied: ""Oh my God, it is around my back."" One of his pals attempted to unbutton his shirt as the king cobra made a spine-tingling hiss to ward off any helpers. Its 7ft body eventually fell out of his shirt and the man was able to make a remarkable escape. The video went viral online and has more than 7,000 views. ""That is an extremely dangerous snake, what a close shave for that guy,"" a Twitter user said. ""Full credit to this guy's nerve control and keeping peace with body and mind,"" one added. ""If this happened to me my heart would stop,"" a second commented. ""That is an extremely dangerous snake - I believe it is a black cobra,"" another said. King cobras are found across Asia and claim the title of the world's longest venomous snake. The biggest one ever found was recorded at more than 19ft in length.

"THIS is the hilarious moment a drunk Benidorm holidaymaker was sent flying by the weight of two towels - now he's recognised at the shops. Scott Pemberton, 36, from Wigan , was heading back to his apartment when he swung a beach bag stuffed with two wet beach towels over his head. But the weight of the bag swept Scott backwards off his feet - leaving his brother Kieron, 38, in stitches. Scott stumbled to his feet and was soon drinking again, but woke up the next morning with a sore neck. He said: ""It all happened so quickly that I wondered what happened. ""I slipped on the tiles and then my hands and the bag probably supported my head. ""We'd had a good few drinks that day so I felt the pain the next day in my back and the top of my neck. ""I feel lucky not to have been in hospital . If the bag was full of bottles or cans and not wet towels it could have been a lot worse. ""Or if the bag had landed differently. I'm glad it was caught on camera because it probably made the holiday . ""People were talking about it and it made people laugh. ""I find it funny now and people have recognised me at the shops in Wigan. ""I'm quite a Jack-the-lad anyway. I won't be doing that again and I won't be going to Benidorm again."" The hilarious clip even ended up being shown to punters on screens at some of the bars the brothers visited in Benidorm. Kieron joked that Scott was only bowled over because of his slim eight-stone weight. He said: ""That's how skinny he is. That a couple of towels could do that to him. ""He's only light and the bag was pretty heavy. It had to be at least a stone with soaking wet beach towels. ""He thought he could swing it over because he was messing around but when he did that it just took his feet. ""I can't believe I had the phone at the right time. I'm glad the bag was there because it could have done damage to his head and then it wouldn't have been funny.

"UKRAINIAN kamikaze drones have unleashed chaos in the heart of Moscow's business district in a three-pronged attack this morning. Fireballs erupted in major buildings while skyscrapers were shattered by the strikes in the early hours of Sunday, just miles from the Kremlin . Chilling screams were heard as explosions ripped through several floors of two office blocks, appearing to cause catastrophic damage. Ukraine , who Russia has blamed for the attack, seem to be giving Vladimir Putin a taste of his own terror as tensions continue to rise. The first of two drones sent to penetrate the capital's much-vaunted air defences struck at 3.20am under the cloak of darkness. It slammed into the 50-storey IQ Quarter Tower, one of the most prominent buildings in the business district called Moscow City. Swish residential apartments and swanky penthouses also reside in the high-rise hub that was rocked by strikes on Sunday morning. Footage then captured the aftermath of the second drone attack, which struck the Oko-2 skyscraper at 4.10am. In one clip, two panic-struck women can be heard gasping as they watch an incoming drone grow closer, saying: ""It flies so quick!"" Another video shot from the Presnenskaya Embankment shows one of the drones crash into a building,  as a woman shouts: ""Mummy!"" Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the facades of two buildings were ""slightly damaged"",  despite the scenes of destruction. The Russian defence ministry claimed that two drones had lost control when they were jammed by electronic warfare technology . It alleged that the other was shot down, while describing the incident as an ""attempted terrorist attack"". A security guard was wounded in the strikes while unconfirmed reports said a 21-year-old woman was also injured. Multiple ambulances were at the scene in the heart of Moscow, close to the White House headquarters of the Russian government. Ukraine has been taking bolder steps in recent weeks to bolster its counter-offensive, which continues to gather pace. One of the buildings struck by the drones houses the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The Ministry of Digital Development, Telecommunications and Mass Media's office, part of Putin’s propaganda edifice, is also based here. Government documentation from the ministries was strewn across the debris-littered street below after the attack. A source said: ""The glazing was shattered as a result of the blast at the level of fifth and sixth floors of the 50-story building on Presnenskaya embankment."" Putin is sure to have been aggravated by the strikes that came as he prepared to mark Russian Navy Day in St Petersburg and Kronstadt. The drone ambush even forced flights from major Moscow international airport Vnukovo , which is regularly used by the warlord and his goons, to be temporarily halted. A source said: ""Vnukovo airport is closed for arrivals and departures. ""Flights are being redirected to other airports. One flight is in the waiting area."" It was later reopened as air defences got to work in the Odintsovo district. The Kremlin bluntly threatened the use of nuclear weapons in wake of the strike, saying: ""There is simply no other way out."" Dmitry Medvedev - former Russian president who is now Vladimir Putin’s deputy on the powerful Russian security council - warned: ""Our Armed Forces, repelling the counteroffensive of the collective enemy, protect the citizens of Russia and our land. ""This is obvious to all decent people. But beyond that, they prevent world conflict. ""After all, if we imagine that the offensive of the [Ukrainians] with the support of NATO was successful, and they seized part of our land, then we would have to, by virtue of the rules of the decree of the President of Russia dated 06/02/2020, go for the use of nuclear weapons. ""There is simply no other way out. Therefore, our enemies must pray to our warriors. They do not allow the global nuclear fire to flare up."" As celebrations for Navy Day approached, he also bragged about Russia's new high-speed underwater kamikaze drone , which could unleash nuclear Armageddon . Although it is still in development, Putin's puppets claim it could easily drown the UK under a giant radioactive tsunami . Medvedev added: ""Poseidon unmanned aerial vehicle joins the congratulations [for Navy Day] and recommends that the enemies of our country pray for the health of all Russian sailors."" Reports of an intense drone attack on annexed Crimea also surfaced, although Ukraine have not yet commented on any strikes. The disputed region's defence ministry claimed that 25 drones had been repelled. A statement said: ""Sixteen Ukrainian UAVs were destroyed by air defence fire. ""Another nine Ukrainian drones were suppressed by electronic warfare and crashed in the waters of the Black Sea and Cape Tarkhankut without reaching their target. ""There were no casualties or damage as a result of the foiled terrorist attack. Moscow routinely downplays attacks by Ukraine in an attempt not to alarm people and keep up their facade of success. Putin instead encouraged the Russian people to concentrate on the nation's military might as he celebrated the annual Navy Day. A parade of fearsome warships and nuclear submarines graced the Gulf of Finland and on the River Neva near St Petersburg. Alongside the 45 vessels, around 3,000 navy personnel also took part in Sunday's spectacle on dry land. Putin was joined by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, the head of the Navy. The trio inspected some of the ships from a launch boat on the Neva, before the Russian President said a few words to mark the occasion. He bragged in his speech: ""Today, Russia is confidently implementing the large-scale tasks of our national maritime policy and is consistently building up the strength of our Navy. ""This year alone, 30 ships of different classes are being added to the fleet."" Among the vessels set to enter combat is the Merkury corvette, named in honour of the Black Sea Fleet's sailing ship which gained its glory in the Russo-Turkish War. But the tyrant made no mention of his invasion of Ukraine or the strikes in Moscow that have marred Navy Day. The annual parade, which Putin signed into decree in 2017, is to ""honour glorious victories of the Navy that made a substantial contribution to defending the Fatherland"". Experts believe the warlord's days of ruling Russia are numbered - with a former MI6 spy claiming he will be ousted by next year . The combination of his ailing health , his disastrous invasion of Ukraine and the Wagner rebellion seem to have sealed his fate. Christopher Steele, who ran MI6 's Russia desk between 2006 and 2009, said the West needs to ""prepare for the end of the Putin era"". He said ""very credible sources telling us he's been ill for some time "" - suggesting the Russian leader could die suddenly from illness. But he explained that the most likely ending for Putin will be a ""violent"" move to kill or topple him .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/615e698d-4c84-4a99-a798-369628a49d6d.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/970feeb8-bb60-4ad7-820b-22b275242806.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000835056675.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ac-moscow-drone-attack-map.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/russian-president-vladimir-putin-looks-835096838.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-navy-day-celebrated-last-833668148.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/russian-president-vladimir-putin-accompanied-835098060.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000835056686.jpg",Russia warns of NUKE retaliation over Ukraine drone attack as ‘sickly’ Putin takes centre stage at Navy Day parade,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23248634/ukrainian-kamikaze-drone-attack-rocks-moscows-business-district/
"A BABY girl has tragically drowned after reportedly falling off her parents' yacht in Fiji. Little Māhina Toki died on Friday after wriggling free from the harness she was strapped into on the deck and falling into the water. Reports claim the tot had been tethered to the 32ft catamaran named Kalamari while she was watching a film outside. Her parents Mark and Kiri, from Great Barrier Island in New Zealand , were cooking dinner at the time while docked in Musket Cove. The 13-month-old, ""who loved the water and life on the boat"", is believed to have tumbled into the sea just before 5pm local time. The panicked parents launched a desperate search for their daughter after discovering she had disappeared from the deck. Police in Fiji said Māhina was later found floating in the sea. Despite desperate attempts to revive her, the tot sadly passed away at the scene. Officials said the family had been docked at Musket Cove, on Fiji's western coast, since late July. A fundraiser has been launched by a fellow cruiser to assist the family with funeral expenses and travel costs as they return to New Zealand. In a post on the GiveALittle donations page, Grace Palos said the baby girl was secured by a harness but had ""worked free and found the water."" It read: ""Māhina was a beautiful, happy, smiling child who loved the water and life on the boat. ""Her mother, Kiri, said she had eyes that looked into your soul from the day she was born. She was 13 months old yesterday."" Grace said that grief-stricken Mark and Kiri were now doing their best to ""pick up their lives"" as they return home without their daughter. ""To the beloved Māhina, may you forever live in peace, splashing with joy somewhere in the sea,"" the post added. Nearly £10,000 has already been raised to assist the heartbroken parents. Authorities in Fiji are investigating the incident. A spokesman for the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was aware of the tragedy and was providing consular assistance. The resort manager of Musket Cove, Joe Mar, said locals and fellow cruisers raced to help the family as they found Māhina's lifeless body. An off-duty paramedic, doctor, two nurses and a midwife are reported to have tried to revive the baby girl. He explained: ""The family rushed into shore to seek help and a lot of people rushed to their aid, but unfortunately couldn’t revive her."" Joe told the New Zealand Herald the parents have now moved inland to Denarau, where they are being supported by police.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fiji-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1970-s-likes-castaway-plantation-177803628-1.jpg",Baby girl drowns after ‘falling from parent’s yacht when she wriggled free from harness’ in Fiji,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23249190/baby-girl-drowns-falling-from-parents-yacht-fiji/
"A LOTTO winner who scooped an amazing £8million jackpot has baffled fans with his latest purchase. Kursat Yildirim , 42, raked in millions in cash after he secured the golden ticket in September last year. Kursat - also known as Chico - became an overnight sensation after his whopping German lotto 9.9 million euros (£8.47million) win. He splashed out big on supercars in a huge spending spree, buying a £392,000 Ferrari and a £218,000 Porsche following his win. The reformed fraudster was also spotted with a pet alligator and splurged some of his winnings on a penthouse. Now the former crane operator - from Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia State - has astonished followers with a new inking. The simple tattoo shows a black line running from his neck down his left arm before encircling his biceps just before his elbow. The inking then takes a turn and runs down the other side of his arm to his wrist. Kursat posted a short clip on his social media channels on July 29 from his session with Dortmund tattooist Marcel Dudek. In the video, the bare-chested lotto winner says: ""Oh man, that hurts."" Asked by local media what the £214 tattoo means the ex-convict said: ""The explanation is quite simple. But I love how people are debating the possible reason."" Chico added: ""When I went to Africa, I met a man from Canada who had a similar tattoo. I immediately loved it. I adapted it a bit though."" The millionaire explained: ""The line is supposed to represent my lifeline. ""My life didn't always go as planned, that's why the line takes a harsh turn up there."" Kursat was born in Turkey and came to Germany at the age of just 12. In February 2021, he was sentenced to 27 months in jail for fraud and robbery but was released early due to good conduct and his willingness to undergo therapy. He reportedly robbed amusement arcades to feed his gambling and drug addiction. Chico said the tattoo - which took 90 minutes to complete - was his first professional inking but also will be his last. He told local media that he once tattooed his own finger in prison . But he emphasised: ""These two tattoos , that's it for me. They were exceptions and mean a lot to me."" Kursat's latest tattoo was met with mixed reactions as some of his 865,000 Instagram followers wondering about his motivation. One asked: ""What's the point of getting a line tattooed?"" Another added: ""There will always be many different opinions, especially when it comes to tattoos. But I'll never understand why anyone decides to get a tattoo like this one."" Chico recently posted a video in which he chats with some kids in his neighbourhood and told them to ""listen to your parents"". He added: ""Don't smoke, don't drink and don't take drugs ! Stay away from such people and never return home late."" Chico concluded: ""And remember that there are things in life you cannot buy for money."" Ever since hitting the jackpot last year, the bachelor - who still lives with his mum - has been on a non-stop spending spree. Experts estimate he has blown at least half his fortune by splashing on luxury properties, businesses and a fleet of luxury motors like Ferraris and Porsches. Asked about his fancy cars, Kursat said: ""I just got them for the haters. For all the envious people."" He even bought his brother Yunus a Ferrari GTB 296 worth £428,000. And Kursat reportedly also purchased a 20-hectare plantation containing 6,000 almond trees in his native Turkey. Earlier this year, Kursat admitted he was still spending about £428 on lottery tickets each week. Speaking about his future plans, the multimillionaire said: ""The great thing about it is that you can make so many people happy. I immediately transferred money to my parents and my brothers. ""I'd love to go to Africa again to dig wells and give presents to the children there.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1e666276-75b4-4147-9d0c-9efb4283e35c.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-shows-kursat-yildirim-aged-835495306.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-shows-tattoo-kursat-yildirim-835495301.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kursat-yildirim-aged-41-poses-773659057.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-shows-kursat-yildirim-42-812794402.jpg",I won £8million lottery jackpot – I’ve got sports cars and mansions but everyone is baffled by my latest purchase,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23291921/won-10m-lottery-jackpot-baffling-purchase/
"POLAND have ramped up the number of troops deployed on the border of Belarus. Polish authorities are protesting the ""violation of its airspace"" by two Belarusian helicopters today as tensions flared in the Ukraine War. In a statement, the Polish defence ministry said: ""There was a violation of Polish airspace by two Belarusian helicopters that were training near the border."" Warsaw authorities said that in reaction, they were going to increase Poland 's military presence along the border. And they added that they had summoned Belarus' top diplomat in the Polish capital in protest. Poland's ministry added that ""NATO was notified"" about the incident. The Foreign Ministry called on Belarus to “immediately and in detail” explain the incident, which it said was an element of the escalation of border tensions between the two countries. “Poland expects Belarus to refrain from such activities,” read an official statement. But the Belarusian military denied any such violation and accused  Poland - one of Ukraine's most fervent backers in its conflict with Russia - of making up the accusation to justify a buildup of its troops. It comes as Vladimir Putin vowed to put tactical nuclear weapons in Nato’s backyard as Ukraine’s long-awaited fightback gained momentum. The Kremlin tyrant said he will deploy the nukes in Belarus this month. Putin met his henchman, Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko , in Russia’ s Black Sea city Sochi back in June. He reportedly told him : “We will immediately begin activities related to the deployment of appropriate types of weapons on your territory.” It is the first time since 1991 that Russia has moved tactical nuclear weapons on to foreign territory and comes after a pact was signed by Lukashenko last month . Russia will keep control of the nukes, which can be launched on Iskander-M missiles or from Su-25 planes. Belarus has both. Poland and its neighbours on NATO's eastern flank have voiced concerns about a potential threat from Belarus which now hosts the Wagner mercenary group. Anxieties were sparked after mercenaries from the Russia-linked Wagner group arrived following their short-lived rebellion against the Kremlin in June. On Saturday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said a group of ""one hundred Wagner mercenaries"" in Belarus had moved closer to the Polish border. Morawiecki called it ""a step towards further hybrid attack on the Polish territory"". He said: ""They will probably be disguised as Belarusian border guards, helping illegal migrants to cross into Polish territory, to destabilise Poland."" But Lukashenko denied Poland's claims that about 100 of the Wagner mercenaries have moved closer to the border, according to a statement published by his office. “I suddenly hear the other day that Poland has freaked out that allegedly some unit as large as 100 people is moving here. No PMC Wagner units 100 people strong have moved here. ""And if they have, they did it only in order to pass on combat experience to the brigades, which are stationed in Brest and Grodno,” Lukashenko said during a working visit, according to the statement.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/polish-prime-minister-mateusz-morawiecki-834894038.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-66.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-72.png",Tensions flare as Poland ramps up troops on Belarus border after Putin ‘ships tactical nukes’ to puppet pal Lukashenko,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23293244/tensions-poland-troops-belarus-border-putin/
"TOURISTS in Spain have been given an urgent warning after shocking footage showed beachgoers facing off with a pack of wild boars. The animals were spotted searching for food by holidaymakers on a beach in Estrella del Mar, near Marbella , last weekend. Wild boars can be dangerous to humans if provoked - especially during breeding season or if or wounded. Video footage shows six boars trotting through the sand with beachgoers in the holiday hotspot left gobsmacked. They were seen sniffing around deck chairs as they scoured the area for food before digging through rubbish bags in search of scraps. Dozens of bathers in Spain carefully retreated to avoid getting accidentally attacked. However one brave man decided to fight back against the boar invasion. With his drink in hand, he ran after the boars while shouting at them loudly in a bid to scare them off. In the clip, he succeeds in forcing the wild animals a few feet away. But the video shows the animals remain on a sand dune ready to pounce again when the man turns away. A third piece of footage seems to show they soon returned as they can be seen digging through the rubbish next to his bags. But the unusual sight was not uncommon with wild boars often seen around Spanish beaches. Experts say that they are ""intelligent animals"" who will work out where food is. Wild boar expert Dr John Dutton previously told Express.co.uk : “What we have to remember is they are very intelligent animals, at least as intelligent as adult dogs if not more so. “They will work out where food is and that sort of stuff and there isn’t much that will predate (eat) them. “They’re probably coming partly because of population increase and partly because we’re getting drier summers so there is less food available. “Milder winters mean they’re not suffering as much winter mortality and then their population increases so there’s a space issue and they start to look for food elsewhere.” Last year, a 140lb wild boar emerged from the Med in front of stunned tourists and raced up a Costa del Sol beach. The powerful animal , believed to be around three years old, made a dash along the sand late yesterday morning at family-friendly Benajarafe Beach near Malaga . Frightened tourists and locals were heard screaming as the 10-stone beast swam towards the shoreline, with one overheard yelling in Spanish: ""Watch out, it’s coming out of the water"". It narrowly missed an elderly couple in their swimwear and a topless young woman in a bikini bottom as it rampaged up the beach before disappearing into reeds behind the sand. Animal experts and police warned people who encounter the uncontrollable animal to ""stay still and not harass it"" for their own safety.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a1e838dc-4b0f-493c-bceb-36a11c439732.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/surreal-moment-group-frenzied-wild-835491575.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/surreal-moment-group-frenzied-wild-835491481-1.jpg",Spain holiday warning as shocking footage shows tourists face off with pack of wild BOARS on Marbella beach,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23293784/spain-holiday-warning-shocking-footage-wild-boars/
"A MAN and his mum allegedly held a sex slave for 14 years in a dungeon and forced her to dismember another woman's corpse. The alleged victim claimed the shocking ordeal started in 2009 when she was kidnapped by a ""maniac"" in Russia . And she claimed to have been raped 1,000 times during over a decade in captivity before escaping the horror dungeon. Her alleged captor, named as Vladimir Cheskidov, 51, is currently under armed guard in a psychiatric hospital , facing a criminal investigation into murder, rape and kidnapping. The man’s mother Valentina lived in the same timber village house and was aware of the kidnapping of his victims, according to local reports. The woman, now 33, claimed that Cheskidov killed and dismembered another woman in the dungeon before boiling the remains. She alleges that her captor then forced her to help him cut up the woman’s body and stuff the remains into a large pot - which he then buried in the cellar. The victim managed to flee after Cheskidov got drunk and forgot to lock her in the basement. After her lucky escape, she managed to find her sister, who she had not seen for 14 years, and call the police . “She has begun to tell [me] everything”, said the sister, according to reports in Russia. “How a man held her, tied her up, taped her hands, sealed her mouth with tape.” The sister continued: “There was another girl there [when she was first held aged 19]. He introduced [that girl] as his wife. “But then, I don’t know what kind of conflict they had, he plunged  a knife right into her head…. He said to her, according to 74.ru : “If you behave the same way, you will get the same [punishment]. “Then he dismembered her and she had to help him. Remains, arms and legs, were packed in a barrel....to bury [them].” Investigators confirmed that they found body parts in a cellar. Cheskidov reportedly threatened her with a knife, tied her up, and taped her mouth shut with duct tape before locking her in a room with a padlock. He freed her to do housework, and she was expected to clean, cook, and look after his mother. The woman said she was subjected to repeated sexual abuse during her time in captivity. However, Cheskidov's mother said at a custody hearing that the woman had lived with them voluntarily. She said: ""She joined my son and lived like a queen. No-one kept her.” “She lived [with us] at her own free will. We have all the doors open [in the house] - come in, run away. “Every day it was like this.” The mother was bailed by the court and faces travel restrictions as well as potentially being jailed for 15 years over the kidnapping charge. At the same hearing, Cheskidov, looking haggard and unshaven, broke down in tears and denied any wrongdoing, telling a judge that he and the woman shared a ""mutual love"" for one another. The room where the woman was kept was equipped with various muzzles, while laptops and disks with pornography were seized from the house, as well as sex toys used during the alleged torture sessions. Cheskidov is also said to have forced her to drink vodka with him, and ""severely beat"" her. Vladimir Cheskidov was detained until September 30 pending further investigations. There are also investigations into the fate of Cheskidov's father, and an earlier wife, who both died, according to local reports. Allegedly, his wife had died after falling out of a window, while the father slipped and fell resulting in his death.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/346e2f6e-129e-47bf-ad46-dc486f06eea6.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ekaterina-b-now-33-fled-835453809-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-76.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-77.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ekaterina-b-now-33-fled-835453801-1.jpg","Dungeon monster and his MUM, 72, ‘held sex slave for 14 years & forced her to dismember her dead friend’s corpse’",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23293953/monster-and-mum-sex-slave-horror-dungeon/
"MCDONALD'S has made a major change to its menu after dropping a popular item from meals in India. Fans of the fast-food chain were left stunned after the restaurant removed tomatoes from their burgers and wraps in many parts of the country. The move came after Maccies was hit by supply shortages and quality concerns after prices of the vegetable soared to records. The costly tomato has wreaked havoc on wallets, in kitchens and even on the streets. In some regions, wholesale prices of the staple of traditional Indian cuisine have surged 288% in a month to a high of 140 rupees (£1.33) a kilo on Friday. And with retail prices soaring even higher, many have been spurred to cut back on consumption of the popular vegetable. The government blames the higher prices of tomatoes on a lean production season when monsoon rains disrupt transport and distribution. ""Despite our best efforts, we are not able to get adequate quantities of tomatoes which pass our stringent quality checks,"" read notices posted in two McDonald's stores in New Delhi. ""We are forced to serve you products without tomatoes."" Store managers said the problem was due to quality issues in the supply chain, rather than pricing. Connaught Plaza Restaurants, which runs about 150 outlets as McDonald's franchise in India 's north and east, attributed the decision to ""temporary"" seasonal issues. However, Westlife Foodworld, the McDonald's franchise for India's western and southern regions, with 357 restaurants, said there were ""no serious tomato-related issues"". The problem was seasonal and forced 10 to 15 per cent of its stores to stop serving tomatoes temporarily, it said. However, McDonald's Delhi stores still offer sachets of tomato ketchup. And a nearby Subway restaurant said there were no issues serving tomatoes. Arvind Malik, a tomato farmer from Haryana state, told the Guardian that while he usually sold 30,000kg of tomatoes every year, this year he could only harvest half of that as his crops had been destroyed by pests. ""Experts told us that irregular weather - sudden rise and decline in temperatures - is the reason behind the diseases in our tomatoes,"" he said. In the financial capital of Mumbai , vegetable vendor Vijay Sharma said sales had fallen off from the 40kg he used to peddle each day. Mr Sharma said: ""Most of my customers have stopped buying tomatoes. Now, I only bring five kilos."" The skyrocketing prices have been particularly hard on India's middle and lower classes, who make up the bulk of the population. In the western city of Pune, a vegetable seller allegedly smacked a customer in the face with a weighing scale for bickering over the price of 250g of tomatoes. There have also been reports of people stealing tomatoes from fields and hijacking tomato-laden trucks. It comes after consumers have battled higher prices of items ranging from milk to spices in recent months.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vendor-loads-tomatoes-bag-customer-835511737.jpg,McDonald’s makes major change to its menu as it drops popular item from burgers in India,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23294417/mcdonalds-major-change-menu-india/
"A MAN known as Italy's Robinson Crusoe is set to leave an island 32 years after he washed up there. Mauro Morandi, 81, settled on the island of Budelli in 1989 after giving up his job as a PE teacher. But now Mauro, after all these years, looks set to finally move on following pressure from the authorities. ""I will leave hoping that in the future Budelli will be protected as I have protected it for 32 years,"" he wrote on Facebook on Sunday. After he washed up on the island off northern Sardinia Mr Morandi learned that the caretaker was retiring from his post, so he sold his catamaran and took on the role. He soon became known as Italy's answer to Robinson Crusoe. But over the last decade he faced pressure from park authorities to move on. In 2020 the president of La Maddalena's National Park, Fabrizio Fonnesu, told CNN that Mr Morandi had carried out illegal alterations to his hut. In the past the Italian has described himself as a ""bit of a rebel."" Despite a petition calling on the authorities to allow him to stay, it now appears that Mr Morandi is set to move on. Speaking to The Guardian he said that he planned to relocate to the nearby island of La Maddalena. He added: ""My life won't change too much, I'll still see the sea."" Budelli forms part of Maddalena Archipelago National Park and is associated with its pink coloured beach.

"VLADIMIR Putin's evil thugs brutalised Ukrainians with electrocution and sexual violence in horrifying torture chambers, an investigation found. Never-before-seen photos reveal the chilling derelict buildings where hundreds of captured Ukrainian soldiers, teachers and medics faced barbaric abuse. New evidence shows almost 50 per cent of those held in the Kherson torture dungeons faced suffocation, waterboarding, severe beatings and threats of rape. At least one victim was forced to watch another prisoner being raped with a foreign object covered in a condom, according to Global Rights Compliance's investigation. A specialist unit led by world-renowned British human rights barrister Wayne Jordash KC also uncovered evidence of vile tactics used by pro- Russian perpetrators. One Russian soldier ordered sexual violence in the form of genital electrocution against 17 separate victims in the Kherson detention centres. Dozens of victims have also told how they were electrocuted during interrogations. Evidence being uncovered “suggests that Putin ’s plan to extinguish Ukrainian identity includes a range of crimes evocative of genocide”, Wayne said. The firm's Mobile Justice Team has been supporting Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General’s probe into Putin's war crimes. They have identified more than 35 torture chambers in the now-liberated Kherson region - with the hunt for offenders underway. Since a large part of the embattled Kherson Oblast was liberated in October, specialist teams have been analysing more than 300 cases of detention in the area. Of those victims, at least 43 per cent told of practises of torture and said sexual violence was common. Haunting images show where Ukrainians were forced to write and learn the National Anthem of Russia and pro-Russian slogans during their detention. Other images show the eerie corridors of the chambers and ominous graffiti on the wall in Teploenerhetykiv Street including a note that translates as ""dawn comes after sunset"". Anna Mykytenko, senior legal adviser and Ukraine country manager at Global Rights Compliance, said the investigation is in its early stages - but convictions could be on the cards in the future. She told The Sun: ""The pictures speak for themself - they're horrifying. ""We have victim statements, medical reports and intelligence information, as well as physical evidence such as handcuffs."" Anna warned that was has been uncovered in Kherson is ""just the tip of the iceberg in Putin’s barbaric plan to obliterate an entire population"", She added: ""The true scale of Russia’s war crimes remains unknown, but what we can say for certain is that the psychological consequences of these cruel crimes on Ukrainian people will be ingrained in their minds for years to come. ""Justice will be served for Ukrainian survivors as we continue our mission to identify and hold perpetrators accountable."" Kherson suffered nine months of enemy occupation and The Sun's defence editor Jerome Starkey joined Ukraine’s special forces hunting Russian stragglers. Police commandos scoured the docks for sleeper cells and booby-traps while residents got back to their lives after months of hell. The city had no power or running water and thousands braved the rain and freezing temperatures to queue for food hand-outs, as most of the shops were shuttered. Last month, the UN human rights office said Russian forces have carried out widespread and systematic torture in Ukraine. Hundreds of victims including children and elderly people have detailed horrific treatment in detention centres. Many said they had been subjected to torture and in some cases sexual violence. Wayne Jordash KC, who is leading the investigation in Kherson as managing partner and co-founder of Global Rights Compliance, said the team is determined to prosecute those behind the wicked crimes. He said: ""The torture and sexual violence tactics the Office of the Prosecution is uncovering from the Kherson detention centres suggests that Putin’s plan to extinguish Ukrainian identity includes a range of crimes evocative of genocide. ""At the very least, the pattern that we are observing is consistent with a cynical and calculated plan to humiliate and terrorise millions of Ukrainian citizens in order to subjugate them to the diktat of the Kremlin."" It comes after shocking evidence of torture emerged from Izyum after the city was liberated. Horrifying images showed what appeared to be a homemade electric chair. Taras Berezovets, who serves with the Ivan Bohun brigade of the Ukrainian army’s special forces, said the Russians “used electric shocks to torture prisoners of war and civilians”. He explained that the “chair stands on a wooden platform” so that the torturer carrying out the interrogation “can avoid electric shock”. “The wires with which the prisoners were interrogated are visible on the left in the wall,” he added. Berezovets also posted footage of another torture chamber where he said Ukrainian prisoners were held four per cell. At least 10 torture chambers where local people were brutalised in squalid conditions by the Russian occupiers were also found.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lhs-torture-chamber-kherson-teploenerhetykiv-835498533.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lhs-torture-chamber-kherson-teploenerhetykiv-835498531.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RTRMADP_UKRAINE-CRISIS-TORTURE_808031723_RC223Y95RV4M_2023-08-01T230240Zjpg-JS835540531-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lhs-torture-chamber-kherson-teploenerhetykiv-835498513.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/view-shows-basement-office-building-835540523.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lhs-torture-chamber-kherson-teploenerhetykiv-835498532-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/electrichair2.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cbecd0a5-ede3-4303-84a9-1272e400ebc7.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bloody-murder-inside-putin-s-762179547.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/a6eef8ea-11d1-457e-a2f0-1d3260f5c413.jpg",Chilling unseen photos reveal Putin’s torture dungeons where Ukrainian prisoners suffered barbaric electrocution & rape,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23254625/putin-torture-dungeons-ukrainians-rape/
"THIS is the shocking moment a violent mass brawl erupted between a group of Brit tourists and street sellers in Ibiza. Footage showed the holidaymakers suffering a barrage of kicks and punches in the popular party resort of San Antonio - leaving several injured. Video showed a group of men laying into a bare-chested rival - who was described as being British by locals. They were filmed smashing him in the head and kicking him to the ground as he tried to get up. One of his pals then sprinted across to the street to help and tried to land a punch on one of the aggressors before running away. Moments earlier, a group of young men and women - believed to be from the UK - were seen fleeing the area. And an unidentified man also appeared to be laying unconscious on the beach near where the violence was taking place. It wasn't immediately clear if the man was with the Brit tourists or the street sellers - and whether it was related to the vicious brawl. San Antonio officials confirmed the clash happened around 6.30am on Sunday near the resort’s main beach called S’Arenal. Although there were reports of injuries, the two groups were said to have fled before police reached the scene of the scuffle. Cops are now scouring CCTV footage to try to identify those involved. It's not yet clear what sparked the violence. San Antonio is packed with Brits in the peak summer season. And last month it emerged police in the resort were hunting a British woman over a horror bottle attack on a hotel boss. The holidaymaker - who hasn't been identified - allegedly used the bottle to slash her victim’s throat after refusing to pay a drinks bill. The deputy director of the hotel in San Antonio reportedly stepped in after the assault. The attacker fled the scene after leaving the female staff member with serious injuries. She is still believed to be on the run. It comes after a mass brawl erupted on a Spanish road aptly dubbed Sin Street in Catalonia. Footage showed drinkers smashing chairs over each other's heads and hurling glass bottles in the beach town of Sitges. It is understood the fight started between a bouncer and a passerby at a venue on Primer de Maig Street - one of the town's main nightlife strips - in the early hours of July 23. But the scrap quickly escalated into a wild brawl involving around 40 people. Dramatic footage shows drinkers battering each other with chairs, tables, glass bottles, stools, and metal bars. During the scuffle, two cops suffered dislocated joints, while another officer was left covered in cuts after being hit by a flying glass bottle. No arrests were made and no suspects have been identified, as those involved in the skirmish quickly dispersed from the scene.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/42b6ca59-0e7a-411f-9fca-b177bebbaf58.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/246c877f-7b6d-438e-98fd-d6479695babb.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/117739e8-7bc5-4d5a-a818-f80fe1cfe2e1.jpg",Shocking moment Brits brawl with Ibiza street sellers who viciously punch and stomp on holidaymakers before fleeing,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23294944/moment-brits-brawl-ibiza-street-sellers/
"A RED weather alert has been activated for parts of the Costa del Sol as temperatures are set to rocket to 42C. Scorching temperatures are set to sweep through Spanish holiday hotspot Malaga today. According to Spain's weather service Aemet, the hottest part of the day will be between 1pm and 9pm local time. Forecasters have warned temperatures could hit a sweltering 42C during this time. A note on Aemet's website says: ""The red warning threshold is expected to be reached at points in the metropolitan area of the city of Malaga and the lower part of the Guadalhorce valley."" On Thursday the warning will be downgraded to yellow as temperatures will drop to highs of 38C. At night, temperatures will still remain between 26C and 29C until Friday. Heatwaves have swept across southern Europe in recent weeks and wildfires erupted in the Spanish island of La Palma in July. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken. It comes as holidaymakers in Spain have been warned they could face a £260 fine for hogging prime beach spots using towels and sun shades. Torrox has become the third town in Malaga to introduce fines from £43 to £260 for those who reserve a spot at the beach. The move comes after fed-up locals reported not being able to find a spot on the beach in the morning with tourists reserving spots by plonking down umbrellas, chairs, and towels before going back to their hotels . One told local media that the practice is so widespread it is impossible for locals to ""get up later than eight in the morning because otherwise, they won't have a spot"". Spanish police said that if they find unattended belongings on the beach, they will wait for one hour and, if no one returns within that time, the items will be seized. If the confiscated items are not claimed within the next ten days they will be destroyed. The tourists must pay the fine to get them back if they are claimed. Similar bans are in place in the towns of Velez and Algarrobo, while authorities in Gandia, Torrevieja, Cullera, and Oropesa del Mar in Valencia also dish out financial penalties to offenders.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/view-beach-nerja-malaga-province-731915303.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/urgent-holiday-warning-orange-alert-835599815.jpg",Urgent holiday warning as ‘red alert’ issued for Costa Del Sol as temperatures set to soar to 42C,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23294992/red-alert-costa-del-sol-temperatures/
"THE mother of vegan influencer Zhanna Samsonova has devastatingly told of how she begged her to come home the day before she died. The 39-year-old is feared to died from starvation and exhaustion after attempting to live off an extreme fruit-only diet in Southeast Asia. The Russian national - known as Zhanna D'Art to her social media followers - died on July 21 in a Malaysian hospital. She previously told her followers that she had spent the last four years of her life eating and drinking ""only fruits, sunflower seed sprouts, fruit smoothies and juices."" Her mother, Vera Samsonova, said she had caught a ""cholera-like infection"" - exacerbated by her diet - just hours before she was due to fly home from her travels. Vera, 63, has revealed her heartbreaking last phone conversation with her daughter where she begged her to return to Moscow. ""Zhanna, you need to go to Moscow,"" the 63-year-old had pleaded. ""I understood that Zhanna was about to die, but still I could not help her in any way. My daughter's life has turned into a nightmare,"" she told Russian newspaper Novye Izvestiya. In Samsonova's last moments, Vera explained that seemed to have finally understood the errors of her ways and replied: ""Yes, I was so mistaken."" The mother said that she had ""fought for years"" to save her troubled daughter but was unable to help her in her last moments as she could not fly abroad. Debts had prevented her leaving Russia, but she had been sending her hospitalized daughter all of her earnings. ""She chose this path. I fought for many years [but] she did not listen to her mother,"" she added. In the months leading up to her death, the food blogger's friends feared that her diet was becoming increasingly restrictive and her anorexia was getting worse. One friend, Olga Chernyaeva, told Russian media how Samsonova could barely walk. ""I watched her journey to death for seven years. About five months ago, I met Zhanna in Sri Lanka and she had a haggard look. ""Her legs were swollen... It was amazing that she was still moving - I think she did it through pain."" Chernyaeva added that she was forced to helplessly watch as Samsonova - who refused to get treatment - turned to ""only bones"" and was left bed-bound. ""She was in bed for almost a month. If she got up, it was very difficult for her to walk - it took several minutes to overcome one step of the stairs."" The raw food influencer also had touted online that her body does not ""require"" water. ""I have not drunk water for the last 6 years. This is a common occurrence in those who are on a fruit diet,"" she wrote on Instagram post from last year. ""This is not something that I limit or restrain myself, it's just that my body does not require it,"" she added. Another friend reported how seeing Samsonova several months ago had left her ""horrified"". ""Her hands were like those of my 12-year-old sister, thin,"" they told Russian news outlet 116.ru. ""A few months ago, in Sri Lanka, she already looked exhausted. ""They sent her home to seek treatment. However, she ran away again. When I saw her in Phuket, I was horrified. ""I lived one floor above her and every day I feared finding her lifeless body in the morning. I convinced her to seek treatment, but she didn't make it."" Samsonova regularly promoted her fruit-only diet online, telling her 16,000 followers that: ""I see my body and mind transform every day. ""I love my new me, and never move on to the habits that I used to use."" Even as she grew thinner and weaker, she believed that her diet made her look younger and healthier than her friends. She said: ""I feel very sad when I see most of my peers. Because of junk food, they look much older than their age."" Only days before she died, Samsonova shared the haunting last message : ""Life is meaningless but worth living provided you recognise it's meaningless."" The cryptic note written over a selfie with her mouth open came after seven weeks of conspicuous silence on her Instagram . Samsonova's official cause of death has not yet been determined and her family are currently fighting to bring her body home. The Beat Eating Disorders helpline is open 365 days a year.

"THIS is the terrifying moment a plane smashed onto a busy road in Lagos and exploded into a massive fireball. The horror crash sent locals running for cover as the Air First Hospitality and Tours light aircraft made an emergency landing in the Nigerian capital. The Jabiru J430 plane was reportedly amid a test flight before it nosedived into the northern district of Oba Akran on Tuesday. Incredible footage showed the two-seater descending at rapid speed before its wing clipped a light post. The aircraft then smashes into the ground, skidding on its nose before erupting into flames. Another clip showed the miraculous moment two men were able to escape the inferno as bystanders assisted them to safety. According to the Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau, the two people involved were the pilot and a passenger. A Lagos Emergency Services spokesman confirmed both men onboard survived the crash and were taken to hospital. Ibrahim Farinloye, acting coordinator for the South-West Zonal office, said: ""The control tower confirmed there were only two people on board.

"A CHINESE zoo forced to deny its bear is a human in a costume has been rocked by yet another bizarre video - with the animal waving at spectators. Speculation continues to grow as social media users can bear-ly believe that human-like ""Angela"" is a real sun bear. The Hangzhou Zoo in eastern China can't catch a break as one of its star attractions continues to astound visitors by walking on its hind legs and waving. Noticing its slender legs, baggy roles of fur around the hips and typically uncharacteristic behaviour, people across the world have been poking fun at and questioning Angela's authenticity. With each bizarre viral video, the zoo has been overwhelmed by allegations a person is hiding under a suit of fur. The zoo responded to the wild claims from the perspective of four-year-old Angela: “Some people think I stand like a person. It seems you don’t understand me very well."" “When it comes to bears, the first thing that comes to mind is a huge figure and amazing power … But not all bears are behemoths and danger personified. ""We Malayan bears are petite, the smallest bear in the world.” They also claimed that a human inside a heavy costume would never survive the soaring summer temperatures of around 40C. “If a person did wear a bear costume, they would be lying down within minutes due to the heat,” a spokesman said. Now, animal expert Dr Ashleigh Marshall from Chester Zoo has weighed in on the hot debate. She told the BBC that the animal is ""definitely a real bear"", but conceded that sun bears do often ""look a lot like people in their costumes"". She said the loose skin around the hips is normal and helps them to turn around more easily so as to better fight predators. Hangzhou Zoo has been enjoying a visitor boom following the viral videos of Angela, as 20,000 people are reported to be making the trip to see her daily. Qian Ming told local media he had travelled over 150 miles by train across China to see the bear. ""We travelled overnight last night to get here,"" he said. Other zoos in China have previously faced accusations of trying to pass off dogs dyed to look like wolves or African cats and donkeys painted to look like zebras.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bear3.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bear1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-17.png",‘Human’ bear seen WAVING at crowds just like a person as zoo still insists it is definitely not a man in a costume,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23297711/human-bear-waving-crowds-zoo-man-costume/
"A BRITISH woman was allegedly raped on holiday in Greece by a man she met at a nightclub. The 21-year-old tourist was assaulted at the man's home as his three friends filmed the horror attack, according to reports. The woman had been partying with a pal in the Keramikos area of the city when she met the man and went back to his house - where she was allegedly raped. After a struggle, she managed to escape the property and report the attack to the police , Protothema reports. She told cops that three of the suspect 's friends had suddenly appeared with their phones and started filming her. A case has been filed against an Israeli man for rape. It comes after two men were jailed for life for gang-raping a British woman on her sunbed in Greece. The two Pakistani men, aged 27 and 24, attacked the then 18-year-old on a beach in Rethymno - a city in the north of Crete - in July 2022. The men - who have not been named - reportedly approached the Brit as she sunbathed on a sunbed before launching their horror attack. The young tourist tearfully told a court how the two men pinned her down on the sunbed and raped her. She is said to have reported the rape to the cops immediately after the horror assault on the Greek island. Detectives launched an investigation and swiftly identified and arrested two suspects. The two men reportedly confessed to the gang-rape at the time of their arrest - and were later sentenced to life in prison . Meanwhile, a Brit was arrested at Majorca’s Palma Airport last month after allegedly raping his girlfriend at their hotel on the island. The man was held as he tried to fly home after his partner told cops  he had forced himself on her in the bathroom of their hotel room. The alleged sex attack occurred around 6am at a three-star hotel near the resort of Magaluf . In May, a Brit tourist was arrested and thrown in jail on suspicion of raping a female friend of his son’s at a hotel in Magaluf. He was also held at Palma Airport after allegedly packing his bags and trying to leave the island hours later. The woman, also believed to be British, told detectives she was forced to have sex after falling asleep in her friend’s room which had an internal door leading into his dad’s room.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/elevated-view-monastiraki-square-crowded-835631778.jpg,"Brit tourist, 21, ‘raped on holiday while predator’s pals filmed horror attack in Greece’",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23301272/brit-tourist-raped-holiday-greece/
"A STUNNING influencer is being hounded by her nightmare neighbours over her ""intolerable"" and ""unbearable"" laugh. Leyla Lahouar, 27, a former German Bachelor contestant, has only lived in her flat for two months and is already having run-ins with petty neighbours. The brunette beauty from Frankfurt, who has almost 50k followers on Instagram , said she was fed-up with receiving anonymous letters that slammed her loud laugh. She said: ""Recently, an anonymous note came to me: I shouldn't hold any more meetings on the balcony after 10pm. My laugh is too loud."" The aggressive note read: ""Your unspeakable, indescribable laughter is so loud, extreme, unbearable and intolerable. ""From 10pm. There is a quiet time according to the house rules."" A second irritating note complained that she also being too loud on her balcony. However, Leyla says she ""wasn't even home"" when the alleged rule breach was committed. The note read: ""Be quiet in the flat! After long, reckless balcony meetings and telephoning on the balcony into the night. It was quiet in the condominium before."" The stunned influencer said: ""I rang off all the residents of the house because I would like to know who exactly bothers me that I laugh. ""I enjoy life and laugh, what should I do? Sure, my laughter is loud, but what is accused of me is not true."" She was even asked by one neighbour to add an extra door to her living room because she was being too loud on her phone. But Leyla said: ""I have to live in my apartment. And if the walls are thin, it's not my fault."" Now furious, the influencer said that the second note had gone ""too far"". ""I've been with my mother a lot lately. It was pouring rain, I couldn't do anything on the balcony in this weather. ""Even on days when I wasn't in Frankfurt, I was accused of having parties. Complaints are being made for no reason."" The young TV star also accused her neighbours of tampering with her car in retaliation after finding her windscreen wipers twisted. But Leyla is not going to let herself be intimidated and says she will stand up to her note-making aggressors. ""I'll find out who's doing this. ""And I will continue to live in my apartment like a human being, otherwise, I would have moved to a retirement home.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/influencer-leyla-lahouar-27-city-835591382.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/influencer-leyla-lahouar-27-city-835591281.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-shows-first-complaint-letter-835591367.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/influencer-leyla-lahouar-27-city-835591500.jpg",My neighbours made noise complaint for pettiest reason – I was stunned when a very rude letter landed on my doorstep,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23301314/neighbours-noise-complaint-pettiest-reason-influencer-germany/

"EXTRAORDINARY footage shows a UFO soaring over the sea during a thunderstorm - with a witness describing it as the ""fastest thing I've ever seen"". Carmen Rich was filming a big storm off the coast of Fort Lauderdale Beach in Florida when he saw a ""ball of light"" shoot across the sky . The 29-year-old's startling footage showed the UFO fly past within a split second before stunned Carmen said: ""Wow, did you see that just shoot across?"" He can then be heard asking if anyone else saw it before stopping the video to review the footage - as he ""wondered if he was crazy"". After realising he had managed to capture the mystery object on camera, the financial analyst showed his step-sister Jennifer Rich, 20, who ""blinked and missed it"". Carmen, from Boston, insisted the object couldn't be a drone as it was travelling a ""couple of thousand miles per hour"". He admitted he was scared by the unexplained sight - and bizarrely claimed it could have been an alien craft that the US government won't show the public. He said: ""It was the fastest thing I've seen in my entire life and if it was going that fast I figured it would be making some type of noise but it didn't. ""The thing in the back was a plane and that's where you can get a gauge for how fast this thing was. Jennifer turned around, blinked and then missed it. ""I saw it past the phone with my own eyes. I shouted immediately and ended the video because I wanted to see if I actually did get it. I wondered if I was crazy. ""It was much bigger with my own eyes. The camera shows a light ball but in person it looked much bigger."" Carmen does not believe that ""we're alone in the universe"" - and thinks the object ""was something the public won't know about for a very long time, if at all"". ""I showed some local guys and they said they'd never seen anything like it before in their life,"" he said. He posted his clip to Facebook - where viewers have been left divided over whether it was an extraterrestrial event or not. Carmen rejected claims that it could've just been lightning as he said he heard no cracks. One Facebook user commented: ""Wow, That was incredible!"" A second surmised: ""They [aliens] love thunderstorms. ""This is how they charge their flying ships. ""I have also seen, photographed and filmed it several times myself."" A third said: ""Wow, I had to take a double look when you mentioned it, that's crazy! Good catch!"" But one said: ""[It's a drone] being flown from the boat."" Carmen said: ""I'm not sure what type of drones go thousands of miles per hour."" Another said: ""Could have been ball lightning, considering all the regular lightning going on in the background."" Carmen replied: ""I looked up some ball lightning videos and I just don’t see the two lining up. ""This seemed far larger than what ball lightning has been observed as well. It had to be the size of a sprinter van if I had to guess but at that speed who the heck knows!""

"POPULAR beaches have been closed at a Brit holiday hotspot after an oil spill from a tanker washed up onshore. The disgusting thick black ooze has affected two bays of Gibraltar , with environmental authorities issuing a serious health warning. The spillage reportedly happened yesterday morning near the southern region of Poniente anchorage and has since spread. As a result, Camp Bay and Little Bay have been put on ""red alert"". Both idyllic inlets teem with tourists and are usually full of keen bathers who enjoy the crystal clear water. However, local authorities have urged all swimmers to exercise caution if entering the water. Boaters and recreational fishers close to the area have also been warned. The bungled operation reportedly happened when the vessel, Gas Venus, was taking on fuel and experienced an overflow of its tanks. The amount of oil spilt into the sea has not been quantified. A Government of Gibraltar spokesman told the Olive Press the incident was being closely monitored and a contingency plan was in place. Operations at the port in Poniente anchorage have also been suspended, it was reported. Spanish authorities have been notified. The incident has been slammed by a local Ecologists in Action group. Speaking to Europa Press, Antonio Muñoz said large-scale operations should not be happening so close to shore. He called for ""extreme caution"" and claimed the spillage happened because ""the safety systems did not work"". It comes as beachgoers have been warned to stay out of the water at a popular tourist beach due to high pollution .

"A SURFER has revealed the harrowing moment he fended off a 11ft great white shark as the beast tried to rip off his leg. Brave Jack Frost miraculously managed to swim back to shore with blood gushing from his leg after the terrifying ordeal. The carpenter was savaged by the massive shark at Gnarabup Beach in Western Australia last week. He had been riding the waves in the Margaret River region on when he was ambushed by the underwater beast. The 24-year-old described how he ""ended up getting on its back"" in a desperate bid to scare the shark away. ""It's just come from straight up beneath me,"" the surfer told the Augusta Margaret River Times . ""It hit me with such force it knocked me off the board and I did a backflip."" He told how he tussled with the huge beast as blood started spilling from his leg. ""I'm thinking, if I don't show it I'm a contender, it's just going to nail me again,"" Jack said. ""I ended up getting up on its back and hitting it in the back of the head."" As the struggle continued, he started whacking the shark on the side towards it gills before it ""shot down into the depths"", he told WA Today . The brave surfer said he kept telling himself ""you’re going to be all right, you’re going to survive"". The extraordinary close call was caught on film thanks to a Swellnet camera overlooking the Boat Ramp surfing spot. Chilling footage shows the shark making its way towards the bloke as a wave breaks, before his surfboard flies through the air. As the sea calms, a singular mighty splash can be seen as the great white launches a ferocious attack on the helpless Aussie. The beast sunk its teeth into his left leg, locking him in a deathly grip hundreds of metres away from the shore. But the surfer somehow managed to fight the shark off and escape while his gruesome wound was gushing with blood. He then raced back to the safety of the beach with the great white hot on his heels. The man was able to paddle back to shore despite losing ""a lot of blood"" and being hindered by his savaged leg. An off-duty nurse rushed to give him first aid and tended to the deep gash on the sand before paramedics arrived. The brave bloke was taken to Margaret River Hospital following the dramatic incident with non-life-threatening injuries. Doctors have told him he will recover from the horror attack - but said he would need to wait several months before getting back on the surfboard. The surfer has been hailed as a hero by beachgoers who watched the horror unfold, who credited him with ""saving his own life"". Onlookers told 9News he had ""lost a lot of blood"" after grappling with the great white at the popular beach Down Under. Chillingly, the shark was spotted lurking nearby just 15 minutes after brutally biting the surfer. Officials have urged swimmers to take extra care around the Gnarabup and Prevelly area due to the presence of sharks . They are continuing to monitor activity in the region's coastal waters and asked locals to report any sightings to the Water Police on 9442 8600. In February, a teenage girl was mauled to death by a shark after she jumped off her jet ski to swim with a pod of dolphins. Stella Berry had been enjoying a day on Swan River with her pals when she was attacked by what was thought to be a bull shark. A swimmer was then dragged underwater and killed by a shark in front of dozens of fishermen and beachgoers over a week later. The tragedy at Little Bay Beach near Malabar, the first deadly attack in nearly 60 years near Sydney, left witnesses vomiting and shaking . In April, an 11-year-old boy was mauled by a shark while snorkelling just a few metres from the shore in the Shire of Exmouth. A surfer, 46, then passed away after being ambushed by a shark at a popular beach near Elliston in May.","https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/JACK-FROST.png,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/surfer-s-incredible-act-shark-834198503.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/surfer-s-incredible-act-shark-834198513.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/surfer-s-incredible-act-shark-834198802.jpg",Surfer describes harrowing moment he fought off 11ft great white shark after jumping on its back as it mauled his leg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23306527/surfer-harrowing-moment-fought-off-great-white-shark/
"A PLUS size passenger is demanding airlines fork out for the extra seat she needs on planes. Influencer Jaelynn Chaney says she has been left in ""pain"" and with ""bruises"" after being ""forced to occupy only one seat"". Jaelynn, from the US , has set up a petition arguing for airlines to reimburse travellers who have to buy two seats because of their size. She wrote: ""Being forced to occupy only one seat can result in pain and vulnerability to poor treatment from fellow passengers, including hateful comments, disapproving looks, and even refusal to sit next to them. ""This mistreatment of plus-size passengers is unacceptable, and it highlights the urgent need for better policies that protect the dignity and rights of all passengers, regardless of size. ""Unfortunately, plus-size passengers often experience discomfort and discrimination when flying. ""The lack of a uniform customer-of-size airline policy is unacceptable and must be addressed."" She claims that she and her fiancé were subject to abuse when flying from Pasco to Denver. Jaelynn - who is a size 6X -  wants airlines to provide additional accessible seats or reimburse customers who feel the need to book an extra spot. In a rant to her 133,000 followers on TikTok , she said she can only travel comfortably in two economy seats. She added: ""Plus size travellers need more space. ""Many people agree that plane seats are too small, even for the average size person. ""As a plus size traveller myself I know how uncomfortable and unsafe it can be to squeeze into a tiny airplane seat. ""We are not asking for special treatment or luxury accommodations, we simply want enough space to travel comfortably and safely without fear of being discriminated against because of our size."" So far, almost 30,000 people have signed Jaelynn's petition . On the page, she wrote: ""These passengers should be provided with an extra free seat, or even multiple seats, to accommodate their needs and ensure their comfort and safety, as well as those around them, during the flight. ""By implementing official customers-of-size policies, airlines can ensure that all passengers have a positive flying experience, regardless of their size or physical needs.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tiktok2.png",I’m a XXXXXXL airline passenger and I have to book two seats every time – but airlines should be the ones paying,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23304866/xxxxxxl-airline-passenger-two-seats/
"ONCE an aspiring Russian model, Zhanna Samsonova ended up tragically dying in intensive care thousands of miles from her home. Shocking old pictures reveal a happy, healthy-looking Samsonova before she embarked on a deadly mission to stop drinking water and survive on only raw fruit. The Russian national - known as Zhanna D'Art to her social media followers - died on July 21 far from home in a Malaysian hospital. Her mother, Vera Samsonova, said she had caught a ""cholera-like infection"" - exacerbated by her diet - just hours before she was due to fly home from her travels. The 39-year-old vegan influencer is feared to died from starvation and exhaustion after attempting for years to live off ""only fruits, sunflower seed sprouts, fruit smoothies and juices."" Footage of the social media creator in her 20s reveals a smiling and healthier young woman who had hopes to be a successful model. Comparing it to the last pictures of Samsonova before her death, it shows the stark and painful toll that years of a raw fruit-only diet took on her body. It comes as her 63-year-old mother, Vera, has told of her heartbreaking last phone conversation with her daughter where she begged her to return home. ""Zhanna, you need to go to Moscow ,"" the 63-year-old had pleaded. ""I understood that Zhanna was about to die, but still I could not help her in any way. My daughter's life has turned into a nightmare,"" she told Russian newspaper Novye Izvestiya. The mother said that she had ""fought for years"" to save her troubled daughter but that she had refused to ""listen to her mother"". Her daughter had left Russia in 2006 without a return ticket and spent the last 17 years travelling around Asia, practicing yoga and blogging. In the months leading up to her death, the lifestyle influencer's friends feared that her diet was becoming increasingly restrictive and her anorexia was getting worse. One friend, Olga Chernyaeva, explained how Samsonova could barely walk when she saw her last. ""I watched her journey to death for seven years. About five months ago, I met Zhanna in Sri Lanka and she had a haggard look. ""Her legs were swollen... It was amazing that she was still moving - I think she did it through pain."" Chernyaeva added that she was forced to helplessly watch as Samsonova - who refused to get treatment - turned to ""only bones"" and was left bed-bound. ""She was in bed for almost a month. If she got up, it was very difficult for her to walk - it took several minutes to overcome one step of the stairs."" The raw food influencer also had previously touted online that her body does not ""require"" water. ""I have not drunk water for the last 6 years. This is a common occurrence in those who are on a fruit diet,"" she wrote on Instagram post from last year. ""This is not something that I limit or restrain myself, it's just that my body does not require it,"" she added. Another friend reported how seeing Samsonova several months ago had left her ""horrified"". ""Her hands were like those of my 12-year-old sister, thin,"" they told Russian news outlet 116.ru. ""A few months ago, in Sri Lanka, she already looked exhausted. ""They sent her home to seek treatment. However, she ran away again. When I saw her in Phuket, I was horrified. ""I lived one floor above her and every day I feared finding her lifeless body in the morning. I convinced her to seek treatment, but she didn't make it."" Samsonova regularly promoted her fruit-only diet online, telling her 16,000 followers: ""I see my body and mind transform every day. ""I love my new me, and never move on to the habits that I used to use."" Even as she grew thinner and weaker, she believed that her diet made her look younger and healthier than her friends. She said: ""I feel very sad when I see most of my peers. Because of junk food, they look much older than their age."" Only days before she died, Samsonova shared the haunting last message : ""Life is meaningless but worth living provided you recognise it's meaningless."" The cryptic note written over a selfie with her mouth open came after seven weeks of conspicuous silence on her Instagram . Samsonova's official cause of death has not yet been determined and her family are currently fighting to bring her body home. The Beat Eating Disorders helpline is open 365 days a year.

"A BEAUTY queen has died in a horror car crash after appearing to predict her own funeral just months before. Ariana Viera, 26, is feared to have fallen asleep at the wheel while driving through Orlando , Florida , on July 13. Her mum Vivian Ochoa claimed she rammed into the vehicle in front of her after passing out. Vivian said paramedics rushed to the scene and revived her daughter twice, but she died on the way to the hospital. In a tragic twist, Ariana had posted a video on her Instagram page in May with the caption: “Filming myself for my future funeral because it's always me in the videos, no one else does it.” Vivian told local media: “They revived her and she then had a heart attack. “They revived her again, but she passed away when they were taking her to trauma care.” She added: “My girl fell asleep, she was tired.” The model - who held the Miss Venezuela title - was due to represent Venezuela at the Miss Latin America and Miss World pageants this year. She had been preparing to make her debut in a fashion show in New York City . Ariana had a budding modelling career and also ran her own company called Full House Cleaning. Local media said the victim’s father, who lives in Peru, tried to organise a visa in time for his daughter’s funeral on July 16 but was allegedly issued the document one day too late. Heartbroken fans of Ariana have taken to social media to share tributes. One wrote: ""Always shine bright. I love you."" Another said: ""Rest in peace baby girl. ""It's a shame to see someone so full of life leave in such a way.""

Her in-laws put the ticket in a birthday card in her mailbox outside her home in Yorke Peninsula, Australia - but it sat unopened for three days. The anonymous woman told The Lott: ""I celebrated my birthday on the weekend, and we were out all day. “It wasn’t until we all came home that I decided to open my gifts as a family. “I received a birthday card from my in-laws in the mail, and it had an X Lotto ticket inside.

The fortunate woman added: ""I thought that I would’ve just won $20 — not $2.58 million. “I told my in-laws straight away, and they thought we were pulling their leg. “It’s so surreal. What a great birthday gift.” She said the eye-watering win has changed her life and she wants to now help her family. “This ticket is a gift, so we look forward to giving back to our families,"" she added. “We’ve been looking at buying a house for three or four years, but we’ve had to put it off for quite some time now. “Buying a house will be the first thing we do, which is amazing.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/young-woman-lotto-store-playing-724770580.jpg,I scooped £1.3million lottery jackpot with a ticket I didn’t even buy – it was so surreal & it has changed my life,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23310125/lottery-jackpot-ticket-didnt-buy/
"CANADIAN Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie have announced their separation after 18 years of marriage. Trudeau, 51, and Sophie, 48, announced the news on Instagram on Wednesday, saying the decision came after many ""meaningful and difficult conversations."" ""Hi everyone, Sophie and I would like to share the fact that after many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate,"" the post read. ""As always, we remain a close family with deep love and respect for each other and for everything we have built and will continue to build. ""For the well-being of our children, we ask that you respect our and their privacy. Thank you."" Trudeau's office said the former couple is taking the proper legal steps in their separation: ""They have worked to ensure that all legal and ethical steps with regards to their decision to separate have been taken, and will continue to do so moving forward. ""They remain a close family and Sophie and the Prime Minister are focused on raising their kids in a safe, loving and collaborative environment. ""The family will be together on vacation, beginning next week,"" the statement said. Trudeau and Sophie, who married on May 28, 2005, have three children. They share two sons named Xavier and Hadrien, as well as a daughter named Ella-Grace. The now-former couple first met as children growing up in Montreal. Sophie was a classmate and friend of Trudeau's youngest brother Michel at the time. The two reconnected in 2003 after Sophie was assigned as Trudeau's co-host for a charity ball. They were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony. Over the years, Trudeau and Sophie never shied away from sharing their love and appreciation for each other on social media. As recently as June, Sophie posted a photo on Instagram praising her then-husband in honor of Father's Day. ""This man could carry the love he has for his kids anywhere. Dads, never underestimate your role as mentors in your family for your sons and your daughters,"" she wrote. Also, this year, the prime minister called Sophie -- and his own mother -- ""two of the strongest, bravest, and greatest people we know,"" in honor of Mother's Day. Trudeau has served as the Prime Minister of Canada since 2015 and was narrowly reelected in 2021. The liberal politician, who has championed diversity, multiculturalism and acceptance throughout his time in office, has endured multiple racism scandals over the years. Most notably, on September 18, 2019, TIME published a photograph showing Trudeau wearing blackface make-up to an ""Arabian Night's themed party at West Point Grey Academy. The photo was taken in 2001 and shows Trudeau dressed in a turban and robes with his face, neck, and arms darkened with makeup. The prime minister has since apologized for the picture and labeled his actions ""racist."" ""Yes it was [racist]. I didn't consider it racist at the the time, but now we know better.""","https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/canadas-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-772185202.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/justin-trudeau-son-late-prime-835682519.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/liberal-party-leader-justin-trudeau-474552500.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/timesgrabs-instagram-account-sophie-trudeau-577276705.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/new-bride-sophie-gregoire-waves-835682522.jpg",Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau announces his separation from wife Sophie after 18 years of marriage,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23312401/canada-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-wife-separation/
"EXPERTS have offered up their theories to explain why a ""human-like"" bear was seen standing and waving just like a person in a costume. Bizarre footage of the fuzzy creature greeting visitors at a zoo in China has sparked a host of speculation and conspiracy theories . Sun bear Angela made headlines across the world after being filmed standing tall on her hind legs and waving enthusiastically. But her friendly welcome has sparked a social media frenzy that has left the Hangzhou Zoo dogged by claims it was a human in a very convincing bear suit. Amateur sleuths alleged that costume-clad workers were being sent into enclosures instead of creatures they had come to see. Suspicious social media users said the animal's saggy skin looked more like ""baggy trousers"" than a bear's backside. Experts have now shared their take on the viral clips - and say there is actually a simple explanation for the strange sight. Dr Wong Siew Te, a Malaysian wildlife biologist, said he ""didn't know whether to laugh or cry"" at the online frenzy over Angela. Armed with a wealth of knowledge from his studies on the Malayan sun bear, he confidently declared that she is definitely not human. Dr Wong told the Mirror : ""There is no doubt that it is a sun bear. ""I currently have four rescue sun bears in my centre and it shows that people know very little about them. ""Although their faces do not look like primates, their body definitely looks very much like primates."" But he admitted he had a similar train of thought the first time he saw a female sun bear walking on her hind legs while holding a cub. Dr Wong continued: ""I saw this and was like: 'Wow and yes it looks like a human's wearing a bear suit', but this is just sun bear and that is what is amazing."" He explained the species have the urge to stand tall from infancy to explore and learn more about their environment - especially in a zoo. As the Hangzhou Zoo allows visitors to feed the animals , the bears will be pulling out all the stops to gain the attention of passersby. Discussing the bear's wave, Dr Wong added: ""This is a very big issue because sooner or later they learn this is a positive reinforcement. ""When they stand up, when they get human attention, when they wave their hand, they will get food. ""Once they know that, when they do that, they will do it more and more. And also this is a zoo from China and China, in the past, made up fake stuff. ""All in all, it creates a perfect storm to come up with the story that this is a human wearing a bear suit to a Zoo in order to attract crowds."" Other bear boffins have also chimed in on the debate, debunking conspiracy theories about Angela and her species. Dr Ashleigh Marshall, from Chester Zoo, told the BBC she was ""definitely a real bear"". She confessed that sun bears do often ""look a lot like people in their costumes"", but her saggy skin was actually a defence mechanism. The expert explained the loose skin around the hips is normal and helps them to turn around more easily so as to better fight predators. Animal rights organisation PETA also chimed in on the debate and urged people to have more compassion for zoo animals. It said in a Twitter post: ""It's sad to see the amusement this footage has provoked. ""The bear you see here likely came from a circus where trainers chain bears to a wall and force them to stand on their hind legs for hours. ""If they can’t hold themselves up, they risk choking and hanging themselves."" The Hangzhou Zoo also penned a response from the perspective of four-year-old Angela, saying humans ""don't understand me very well."" “When it comes to bears, the first thing that comes to mind is a huge figure and amazing power … But not all bears are behemoths and danger personified. ""We Malayan bears are petite, the smallest bear in the world."" They also claimed that a human inside a heavy costume would never survive the soaring summer temperatures of around 40C. The establishment has seen a boom in visitors following the viral videos, with 20,000 people reportedly heading to see her each day. Qian Ming told local media he had travelled over 150 miles by train across China to see the bear. ""We travelled overnight last night to get here,"" he said. Other zoos in China have previously faced accusations of trying to pass off dogs dyed to look like wolves or African cats and donkeys painted to look like zebras.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bear3.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/71bff8e1-5a6d-48c8-b4b9-dc1be0ccd8e3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5c2ce81d-cae3-45cb-9e8f-dda91fa7c389.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bear1.png",Cruel theory reveals why ‘human’ bear was seen standing and waving just like a person in a costume,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23310902/new-theory-why-human-bear-seen-standing-waving/
"A WOMAN has got the last laugh after claiming her neighbours harassed her into building a new garden fence. Tayla claimed that the people next door had hurled racial abuse at her and slammed them as ""evil"". In a TikTok clip giving her side of the story, she said: ""So I bought this house six years ago next to the most insane people. ""This is their fence that was already there when I moved in and they take it down in little spots about once a month so I can't let my dogs out."" She alleged that the neighbours told her she had to build a new fence on her property so they could take theirs down, but that they made disgraceful remarks to her in the process. In the video's caption she added: ""They are racist , evil people. ""They have called me every name in the book including '[insert racial slur] lover'."" Social media commenters were quick to take her side and recommend ways of getting back at the neighbours. One wrote: ""Build your fence 5in away from the survey line. ""They can't touch your fence if it's inside your property ."" Another added: ""Put up a new fence and then paint the side facing them a crazy bright pink lol because it's yours they can't touch it but look at it all day."" In the end, though, Tayla went for a similar approach, which she documented in another video. Instead of a crazy colour, she hung a selection of flags on the new fence which displayed her progressive attitude. One bore slogans including "" black lives matter "" and ""women's rights are human rights"", while she also placed a pride flag on the structure. A third banner read ""hate has no home here"" in rainbow-coloured writing and featured small pictures of flags including the American flag, pride flag and trans flag. She captioned this clip: ""Horrible, hateful neighbours harassing you for years? ""Trying to bully you into building them a new fence? ""Build it in on your property and decorate accordingly."" It comes after one man said his life was being ruined by a nightmare neighbour running a brothel from her home , even blaming it for the breakdown of his last relationship.

"THIS is the shocking moment a group of stowaways who perched on a ship's rudder for 14 days and drank their own pee to survive are rescued. The four men made the mammoth trip from Lagos, Nigeria , to Vitoria, Brazil , as they fled economic hardship at home. They ran out of food and water two weeks in and had to drink their own urine and seawater just to make it across the Atlantic. Thankgod Opemipo Matthew Yeye, 38, said: ""It was a terrible experience for me. On board it is not easy. ""I was shaking, so scared. But I'm here."" Fellow stowaway Roman Ebimene Friday, 35, added: ""I was very happy when we got rescued."" A clip of the moment the men were rescued showed a Brazilian police officer passing them a large water bottle as they straddle the rudder. The group managed to put a net up around the giant metal fin to stop them from falling into the ocean while sleeping. However, sleep was rare due to the constant engine noise , leaving the men exhausted, underfed and dying of thirst. Not only that, but they remained almost entirely silent the whole way for fear of being discovered. Yeye and Friday have now applied for asylum in Brazil, while their two companions have returned to Nigeria at their own request. Friday went on to say: ""I pray the government of Brazil will have pity on me."" He left Nigeria after his peanut and palm oil farm was destroyed by flooding, leaving him homeless . Now, he hopes his family will be able to join him in South America of his asylum claim is approved. Father Paolo Parise, a priest at a refugee shelter in Sao Paulo, said that the group's story was one of the most extreme he had heard.

"HOLIDAYMAKERS heading to Spain are being warned that two popular beaches have closed due to sewage water reaching the shores. The Carlotti Cove in Santa Pola and Playa de las Villas de Pilar de la Horadada, in Alicante, will remain closed until the water is deemed suitable for swimming . Officials say they are working to reopen the beaches, Las Provincias reported. The town councillor for Infrastructure, Trini Ortiz, said in a statement that ""there has been a failure in the pump that drives the water collected in Santa Pola del Este to the treatment plant and the automaton that should have issued the notice to the EPSAR managers. She said on Wednesday: ""Upon detecting the spill this morning , we have asked the Ministry of the Environment to take action on the matter as urgently as possible and work has been underway since early morning to repair the system and implement a double notice to reinforce security."" The Councilor for Beaches, Ángel Piedecausa, said that in Santa Pola the emergency protocol has been activated and the beach has closed while signs have been put up and a red flag raised. He said that in Carlotti Cove a ""layer between 10 and 15 centimeters thick is being removed and it is going to be replaced by sand from the same area."" Analysis of nearby beaches is being carried out as a precaution. Mayor Loreto Serrano has apologised to swimmers and thanked them for their patience while work is carried out in the area. She noted that the council has acted quickly to ""put a stop to this unfortunate situation and restore the high quality of the beaches in the shortest possible time."" Meanwhile in Pilar de la Horadada officials said there is short-term contamination in the swimming area in Playa de Las Villas due to faecal matter found in the water. They said samples taken earlier this week, indicate that the contamination levels exceeded twice the maximum values of pollution permitted. The beach has been shut until the results of samples taken indicate the water is suitable for swimming . Earlier this week swimmers were banned from another two beaches in Alicante after ""abnormal"" levels of bacteria were detected in the water.

"A YOUNG Ukrainian doctor was killed on his first day of work when Russia blitzed a hospital in frontline southern Kherson. Dmytro Bilyi, 25, died instantly in a suspected mortar blast. A female nurse standing next to him was left with life-threatening injuries and at least four other medics were wounded. The Sun witnessed the gruesome aftermath with blood marks across two floors of the Yevhen Karabelesh City Hospital. The mortar hit a first floor operating theatre which was empty at the time. Witnesses said Dr Bilyi, an ear, nose and throat specialist, was standing a few yards away and suffered multiple fatal shrapnel wounds. It was his first full day of work after completing an internship. Devastated colleagues said he was “delighted when he went to work that day”. Staff at the Zaporizhzhia State Medical University, where he had studied since 2015, said: ""He was very kind, cheerful, he won hearts, always smiling. “Dmytro studied well, dreamed of becoming a qualified doctor, and was delighted when he went to work that day.” His pal Serhii Marusian said he had followed his mother's footsteps into medicine. It comes as a new investigation revealed that Vladimir Putin's evil thugs brutalised Ukrainians in Kherson with electrocution and sexual violence in horrifying torture chambers. Evidence shows almost 50 per cent of those held in the previously occupied city's torture dungeons faced suffocation, waterboarding, severe beatings and threats of rape. A specialist unit uncovered the evidence of barbaric tactics and abuse used by pro- Russian perpetrators against hundreds of captured Ukrainian soldiers, teachers and medics. Meanwhile, Ukraine has reportedly wiped out hundreds of Russian soldiers who thought they were out of the range of danger. Sources say five US-made HIMARS missiles slammed into the squaddies who were gathered on a beach in the Kherson region. It is claimed that up to 200 of Putin's men were on the occupied Dzharylhach Island when the strikes occurred.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dr-dmytro-billy-killed-yesterday-835666444.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dr-dmytro-billy-killed-yesterday-835651210.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sun-defence-editor-jerome-starkey-835651242.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dr-dmytro-billy-killed-yesterday-835651296.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dr-dmytro-billy-killed-yesterday-835666443.jpg","Ukrainian doctor, 25, killed on first day of job as Russia blitzes hospital in Kherson",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23317048/ukrainian-doctor-killed-first-day-russia-blitzes-kherson/
"A BODY has been found by two paddleboarders floating in the sea just off a popular beach in Barcelona. Local cops confirmed the victim is a 48-year-old male resident of the Spanish coastal city who is believed to have drowned. Local police said the gruesome discovery was made around 8am on Wednesday just off Barcelona's busy Gavà beach. Two girls were paddleboarding out at sea when they saw the body and brought it to the shore, the local authorities said. They immediately alerted the authorities who arrived on the scene and pronounced the man dead. They revealed that the body does not have obvious signs of ""criminality"" and the death is believed to be an ""accident of nature to be determined"". City Hall of Gavà said: ""The Municipal Police, Mossos d'Esquadra and also the Civil Guard have also been contacted, which has taken over the investigation. ""The causes of the drowning are unknown. The identification of the victim, a resident of Cornellà, has been possible thanks to the location of his belongings in the sand."" Cops believe it is the body of a ""bather"" after his belongings were found on the shore. The investigation is ongoing and the autopsy results have not yet been revealed. It comes as two Spanish beaches popular with British tourists were closed yesterday following an oil spill from a tanker. The disgusting thick black ooze coated two bays in Gibraltar , with environmental authorities issuing a serious health warning.

"POPULAR holiday islands in Greece are facing a crackdown on sunbeds after the ""Towel Movement"" campaign has declared war. The sunbed battle started on the island of Paros in the Cyclades after fed-up locals reported not being able to secure a spot at beaches as they were occupied by loungers. The initiative Save Paros Beaches was launched in protest of the excessive spread of sunbeds and members protested at a beach with banners and towels in hand. Residents even reported being barred from beaches by businesses after refusing to pay for a lounger. As a result, three businesses in Santa Maria Beach have already closed, getting hundreds of sunbeds scrapped after the country's top prosecutor ordered an investigation, in response to the complaints. Officials from the Syros Land Registry found violations and immediately ordered the removal of loungers from the beach. Speaking to broadcaster ERT, the mayor of Paros, Markos Kovaios, said: ""The problem is real. We want to solve it and we will not allow any arbitrariness to exist on our island. ""We are checking the businessmen for possible illegal occupation of part of the beach, the relevant expert reports have been sent to the State Real Estate Company, the agency to which all Greek beaches belong."" Minister of Economy and Finance, Kostis Hatzidakis pledged to increase inspections to find beach bar violations. He added: ""We are not going to favour anyone."" Meanwhile, the representative of the Citizens' Movement of Paros Christos Georgousis reported being kicked out of a beach after he refused to pay for a sunbed while pointing out that some businesses even employ bouncers. Asked about the cost of sunbeds in Santa Maria beach, he replied that the sunbeds at the back could start at £35 (€40) and the ones at the front could reach £100 (€120). The Citizens' Movement of Paros argues that business activities are ruining the island while locals are being left with limited space to enjoy the beach. The group said in a previous statement: ""We claim our right to public space, our right to enjoy our beaches that are encroached upon by greedy, socially irresponsible businessmen who occupy beaches in their entirety or exceed their limits by up to 100 times the area they legally lease."" The declaration of the sunbed wars started in Paros but similar initiatives have started to form in other islands including Rhodes, Naxos and Serifos. A different war has erupted in Spain where tourists and locals fight over beach loungers. Spanish council chiefs have said they will get tough with repeat offenders after photos emerged of locals trying to beat Brit tourists to prime spots by setting up sunbeds in the middle of the night. And a man was filmed sprinting for the sunbeds at a Spanish resort before dumping five towels down as others scrambled for a space. While a Brit filmed scenes described as a ""worst nightmare"" when holidaymakers in Majorca rushed to grab sun loungers for a day by the pool.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-facebook-com-photo-fbid-835778509.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2ab7xtk-santa-maria-beach-paros-835492186-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-facebook-com-photo-fbid-835778512.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/P4FF6Bjpg-JS835492328.jpg",Brit hols islands face sunbed crackdown as ‘Towel Movement’ campaign gets hundreds of beach loungers scrapped,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23317258/brit-hols-islands-sunbed-crackdown-towel-movement-loungers-scrapped/
"THE yacht used by Princess Diana during her last summer has sunk in the Mediterranean. Cujo, which once belonged to Dodi Al-Fayed , was reportedly holed after hitting an unidentified object off Beaulieu-sur-Mer, on the French Riviera . All seven passengers were rescued uninjured and safely evacuated on a life raft. But the 80ft boat ended up at a depth of at least 2,430 metres despite salvage attempts. Cujo's latest owner was at the helm when the accident happened on July 29. The Italian , who owns a home in the French Riviera, tried and failed to pump out the water, local media reports. A second attempt was made by a tugboat dispatched to the scene, to no avail. Emergency services were called at around 12.30pm, and 45 minutes later, a rescue boat arrived at the scene to find the yacht's bow partially submerged with some cabins already flooded. The superyacht hit the headlines in the summer of 1997, when the Princess of Wales was photographed aboard with Al-Fayed. Weeks later, on August 31, the pair died in a crash in Paris when their car hit a pillar in the Alma tunnel while fleeing paparazzi. After their death, Cujo fell into disrepair before it was restored by a member of the late owner’s family at a cost of €800,000 (£689,000). The motor yacht had been moored in the port of Beaulieu-sur-Mer but was no longer in pristine condition. “It had regular maintenance problems,” local paper Nice Matin reported. Le Figaro also reported it had had 7,000 litres of fuel on board, but added that there was little risk of significant pollution. In 2020, the superyacht was auctioned and bought by a wealthy Italian family for £171,000. Cujo was built in Italy in 1972 for John von Neumann, a businessman who had made a fortune selling Porsche and Volkswagen cars in the US . Von Neumann told Italy’s Baglietto yard that he wanted the world’s fastest yacht, which was achieved with two diesel turbo engines delivering a top speed of 40 knots. The businessman kept it for a few years before selling it to the son of Adnan Khashoggi, the arms dealer said in the 1980s to be the world’s richest man. He in turn sold it to Al-Fayed, his cousin. In the 1990s, Cujo became a star-studded yacht, as Al-Fayed invited the likes of Brooke Shields, Clint Eastwood , Tony Curtis and Bruce Willis on board.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/9f4a3ba9-a751-4247-8d6c-93ef37d35438.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000835787832.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1997-story-princess-dianas-death-756662223.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/9e4c4f5f-0e5d-4b80-abbd-2f737e92acc5.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-invaluable-com-auction-lot-835782468.jpg",Incredible 80ft superyacht Cujo used by Princess Diana in her final summer with Dodi Fayed sinks after crash in Med,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23317114/80ft-superyacht-princess-diana-dodi-fayed-sinks-mediterranean/

"HOLIDAYMAKERS have been ordered to get out the sea at a popular Majorcan holiday beach following a new shark sighting. The blue shark is said to have been prowling the shoreline, which terrified swimmers and prompted lifeguards to evacuate the beach. The drama occurred this morning at Playa de Palma, a near-four-mile stretch of beach on the popular Spanish island. It runs between Can Pastilla and the former fishing village of El Arenal which attracts hordes of holidaymakers in the summer months. The shark remained there for several frightening minutes before vanishing. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. Blue sharks rarely bite humans but have been implicated in several biting incidents, four of which are reported to have ended fatally. A large blue shark was blamed for an attack on a holidaymaker in Elche near Alicante in July 2016. The 40-year-old victim was rushed to hospital and given stitches to a wound in his hand. The shark sighting today comes after swimmers had to sprint out of the water after two sharks were spotted stalking the shoreline of a popular Spanish beach last week. Lifeguards ordered people to get out of the water after noticing the prowling predators advancing towards the Port de la Selva beach. In June, several sharks were spotted off the Balearic Islands as well as the Costa Blanca. A seven-foot blue shark was filmed gliding through the water at Calo des Moltons, a small pebbled cove in the north of Ibiza which is a popular spot for snorkelling on June 24. That sighting took place just over a week after a shark sparked panic at Aguamarina beach in Orihuela Costa south of Alicante just two days earlier. The same day it emerged the same species of shark had been spotted inside Ciutadella Port in Menorca. Also in June, a group of fishermen in Majorca were left in shock when a massive cow shark approached their boat. A shocking video shows the moment a large animal is spotted approaching their boat in the calm waters of Cap de Formentor, near Puerto Pollensa. The men turned the boat engine off to avoid hurting the beast during their unusual encounter with a species of shark that usually stays at the bottom of the sea. Oceanographer Gador Muntaner, seeking to play down the danger of blue sharks and concerns about the number of sightings this summer, stated this week: “If they’re near the coast, it’s usually because they’re weak, disorientated or have parasites. “It’s almost impossible for a tintorera [blue shark] to kill someone. It’s much more likely you’ll be hit by lightning.” Earlier this week the focus switched to wild boars after they were filmed rifling through tourists’ belongings on a Costa del Sol beach in search of food and water as astonished sunbathers looked on. The remarkable scenes happened at a beach just east of the upmarket resort of Marbella . A pint-sized blonde girl was filmed running towards her mum as two of the hungry beasts came within inches of her as they fought over one of the items they had snatched up from bags left by a sun lounger.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trp-shark1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo-taken-las-palmas-de-796175853.jpg",Majorca beach evacuated as shark spotted prowling near the shore in latest sighting off Spain,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23323402/popular-spanish-beach-shark-majorca-out-water/
"AN ABANDONED time-warp village once built for a hit Hollywood movie starring Robin Williams has become a mecca for urban explorers. The quaint seaside township called ""Popeye's village"" now lays in ruins on the northern tip of Malta but was once a hub of activity. Its eclectic architecture of slanted sea huts and brightly coloured wooden buildings are a throwback to the 1920's set of the film Popeye. It was purpose-built for the Walt Disney live-action musical, which featured late Robin and American belle Shelley Duvall . The adaptation hit the screens in 1981 and grossed more than £47million at box office. However, with the glory days over - droves of adventures now visit the abandoned village seeking nostalgia. TikToker @cristiandiacinto visited the village just a few months ago to show fans what remained. As he stood on a cliff at Anchor Bay he gave a panoramic view of the  eccentric town surrounded by turquoise blue water. Footage then showed everyday life of the town with a few inhabited storefronts and museums that cater to film buffs. The town was also littered with relics from the film such as Popeye's boat and its rickety jetty. Social media users were awe-inspired by his discovery. ""I've been there before - it is amazing,"" a TikTok user said. ""Wow, that was one of my favourite movies when I was a kid,"" one added. ""Looks great, I'd love to take my family there,"" a second remarked. ""Robin was the best, RIP,"" another said. Built in 1979, Popeye's village has also played host to many other Hollywood sets including Gladiator 2 . It's located just a few kilometres away from the village of Mellieha, which takes about an hour to reach by car from the capital, Valletta. According to Passporter, in the summer months a theme park in the area runs in full swing with different rides, workshops and activities. Between June to October, the village also puts on shows for families with tickets costing roughly £13 a pop.

"MANIPUR cops have been accused of handing over two women to a large armed mob before they were paraded down the street naked in a sickening video. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court noted that the police had allegedly given the young victims to scores of men who later sexually assaulted them . The Supreme Court slammed the Manipur government and Indian state police, asking what action had been taken against the cops and if they had been interrogated after the women made their claims. ""For two months there has been a total breakdown of law and order in Manipur, there is no law and order left,"" the court said. ""Police have no control over the situation, looks like for two months police had made no arrests, and had not recorded statements. ""Two women said that they were handed over to the mob by police, has any action been taken against the police?"" they added. The Supreme Court also asked the Manipur Director General of Police to remain in court at 2pm on Friday and be in a position to give an answer. The harrowing video of the alleged attacks by hundreds of young men on the two women has triggered outrage and protests across the violence-stricken state of Manipur. Police stated that the assaults occurred on May 4, with the footage only going viral last month. It shows two naked women being surrounded by a large group of men - alleged to be nearly 1000 - who groped them and dragged them to a field. A police complaint alleges one woman was gang raped and two other male family members were killed before the rioting mob went on to burn down their village. The Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF) condemned the attack on the woman as “sickening” and alleged that one woman was gang raped. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the incident had ""shamed India"" and that ""no guilty will be spared"". ""I assure the nation, the law will take its course with all its might. ""What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,"" he said, breaking more than two months of silence over deadly ethnic clashes in India's northeast. Modi is now expected to make a statement in both of India's Houses of Parliament over the Manipur viral video case on August 10. According to a police report filed on May 18, the two women were part of a family attacked by a mob of between 800-1000 men. The family were said to be fleeing the attack on their village through the forest when they met local police who said they would take them to safety. The compliant claims that they were: “blocked on the way by a mob and snatched from the custody of the police team"". A 56-year-old was said to have been killed on the spot as his three female family members were forced to strip. A 21-year-old woman in the group was reportedly ""brutally gang raped in broad daylight"". Her “younger brother tried to defend his sister’s modesty and life but he was murdered by members of the mob on the spot,” it adds. Manipur Chief Minister Biren Singh said that arrests had been made, without specifying the number of people who were apprehended. ""A thorough investigation is currently underway and we will ensure strict action is taken against all the perpetrators, including considering the possibility of capital punishment,"" Singh said.","https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/2023-supreme-court-india-20-834241319.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/2023-supreme-court-india-20-835651582.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/989cd0d1-0abd-4461-9c35-9f84f6f282c8.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/86a64316-0022-486a-8246-cbb9d2d67b84.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/activists-different-social-human-rights-833857280.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/womens-wing-shout-slogans-indian-833851537.jpg",Manipur cops accused of handing over women to armed mob before they were paraded naked in horror vid,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23324155/manipur-cops-accused-women-armed-mob-paraded-naked/
"THE parents of two kids have been slammed after a shocking image emerged of the pair dangling their legs off a cruise ship balcony. The children - believed to be two boys - appeared to have been left unsupervised on the 130ft cruise ship as they balanced on the edge of the railing. It's understood the boys were on a Royal Caribbean vessel after the snap was posted in a Carnival Cruise Line Miami Blog Facebook group. The caption said: ""Where are the parents?"" One cruise passenger from another ship claimed they witnessed the incident - describing it as ""unbelievable"". Cruise-goer Robert Dempster said: ""This was taken a week ago today at CocoCay. ""The kids were on Serenade of the Seas and the photo was taken from someone on the cruise I was on, on Oasis of the Seas. “Unbelievable, but thank goodness it didn’t end in disaster!"" The parents and kids involved are yet to be identified but Facebook users blasted the adults. One said the family should be ""banned for all cruise ships"". And others branded the ordeal as “insane”, “unbelievable” and “shocking”. The image raised fresh concerns over passenger safety aboard Royal Caribbean cruise ships. But a spokesperson said customer care was the company's ""upmost priority"". According to news.com.au , they said: ""The safety of our guests and crew is our upmost priority at Royal Caribbean International. “To ensure the safety of everyone on board we have a guest conduct policy that all guests must adhere to. ""We remind all guests of this policy, and we take any violations to this policy very seriously.” According to the Royal Caribbean’s conduct policy , passengers breaking the rules of the cruise ship can face “law enforcement” or “removal from a ship at the next port of call”. It happened to one irresponsible passenger in 2019, when a woman was banned for life by Royal Caribbean after climbing over her balcony railing to pose for a photo in her swimsuit. The lady was captured by a fellow passenger with her hands above her head, appearing to pose for a camera behind her. But tragedy has also occurred. A number of people have plunged to their deaths - including a teenager who tried to climb from an eighth floor balcony because he didn’t have his room card. Brisbane man Warwick Tollemache, 35, also fell overboard while on a Royal Caribbean ship bound for Hawaii in May earlier this year.

"AN influencer was killed in a horror car crash that left six people dead in Chile . María Ignacia Celedón, 28, known by her social media fans as MaruRockets, passed away on July 31. She was travelling with her partner, YouTuber Ignacio Carrasco, 32, known as DimeNacho, who was one of two people to survive the crash. Celedón, who regularly posted gaming and pop culture content, was also with fellow influencer Yang Hsin, better known as ShiniPan, 29. Both Carrasco and Hsin survived the crash but required hospital treatment for various injuries. However, Celedón and five others were reportedly killed in the accident in Punta Arenas, located near the tip of Chile's southernmost Patagonia region. Following the crash, Carrasco’s sister Sofía, well known for her YouTube channel The Adventures of Sofía, gave an update on his current state of health . She said Carrasco suffered a broken collar bone and pulmonary contusion and is in hospital in a stable condition. Sofía said: “Thanks to everyone who sent messages and were concerned. With all my heart, thank you. “My brother is physically fine after everything that happened in the accident, but as a family we are mourning and it’s a terrible shame. “I hope you keep my brother in your thoughts so he recovers well. “And Maru as well, so she can rest in peace like she deserves.” In one of his last posts on social media, Carrasco praised his girlfriend for giving him some of the best years of his life. He wrote: “Meeting you has been one of the most important turning points in my life and looking back on our photos, I realise all how far we have come, how much we have grown together and how much we still have left to live. “You are my partner, a person who challenges me to be better and with whom, among many ups and downs, I have spent some of the best years of my life.” Celedón had 26,000 Instagram followers and nearly 10,000 fans on Twitch at the time of her death. An investigation into the fatal accident is ongoing.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mar-ignacia-celed-n-influencer-835813662.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mar-ignacia-celed-n-ignacio-835813569.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mar-ignacia-celed-n-influencer-835813567.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mar-ignacia-celed-n-influencer-835813582-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mar-ignacia-celed-n-ignacio-835813658.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/yang-hsin-influencer-dies-horror-835813739.jpg",Influencer María Ignacia Celedón killed in horror car crash in Chile that left six dead and YouTuber boyfriend injured,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23325271/influencer-maria-ignacia-celedon-car-crash-chile-six-dead/
"SHE fleeced her friends, family and even her own parents for cash - before disappearing into thin air. Multi-millionaire Melissa Caddick mysteriously vanished from her £5.1million clifftop mansion in Sydney, Australia, just 24 hours after cops raided the property on suspicion of fraud in November 2020. As police hunted her down, it emerged the businesswoman, 49, had siphoned over £16million from more than 50 people to fund a five-star lifestyle that included Aspen ski holidays, private chefs, Louis Vuitton watches and Christian Dior clothes. But the mystery only deepened when four months later, a lone ASICS trainer, with the remains of a foot inside , was found by campers 400 kilometers south of her home. DNA tests confirmed the human remains that had washed ashore were Caddick's. Now a documentary called The Real Vanishing Act: The Missing Millionairess, on ITVX, will re-tell the extraordinary story of the woman dubbed the 'con artist of the century' through the eyes of investigators, close friends and her loyal husband, Anthony . For those who entrusted 'financial planner' Caddick with their life-savings so that they could set their children up for a bright future, the saga is almost still too painful to talk about. An inquest in May confirmed only that the mother-of one was dead. The most popular theory is that she took her own life by jumping from nearby cliffs, but darker theories have swirled that she cut off her own foot to put investigators off her trail. In his first UK interview, Anthony tells The Sun that his name was ""blackened"" after being suspected by officers over Caddick's disappearance - and insists he only received $1.95 of her fortune. “I believe she did take her life but I don’t listen to all the theories,” says the hairdresser, 41, who claims he knew nothing of his wife's crimes. “You can’t dwell on that because then you’d be in that rabbit hole forever. “She’s passed and that was all that mattered to me. Nothing hurts worse than the loss of a loved one, especially someone that you love 100 per cent. “So I think the rest of it is just sort of dealing with it and making it work for everybody involved.” Caddick's story reads like a script, so it’s no surprise ITVX are also releasing a drama called Vanishing Act on the same day as the documentary. The brazen financial planner vanished on November 12, 2020, a day after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission raided her Dover Heights home following a tip off that she was running a financial scam and trading without a proper financial services license. She left her mansion in the early morning, without her phone or wallet, and disappeared forever. Further investigation revealed that not only had Caddick been operating without a license but that her entire company, Maliver Pty Ltd, was a sham. The late conwoman had duped those who trusted her implicitly with their millions - creating fictitious share portfolios which showed money invested with her company was growing. In reality, their hard-earned cash was being transferred directly to Caddick's bank account to fund her extravagant tastes. Investigators have since retrieved Chanel handbags, artwork, fast cars and even one bespoke necklace called ‘Stella’ - which featured an 83-carat Australian black sapphire and cost a staggering £180,000. In two weeks alone, accounts revealed that Caddick had splurged over £47,000. Anthony, as he was during the court case and multiple police interviews, is almost unnervingly calm when asked how he’s managed to survive the maelstrom of media interest over his con-artist wife, and her death. His cool demeanour, coupled with inconsistent statements about Caddick's last movements and a 30-hour gap before he reported her missing, led to a character assassination and suspicions about his part in her disappearance. In May, New South Wales deputy state coroner Elizabeth Ryan said he had hampered police investigations, saying she believed he had deliberately withheld information about Caddick's final movements. Yet Anthony - who wed Caddick in 2013 following the end of her first marriage - has never been charged with any offence and the constant scrutiny has left him frustrated and drained. He says: “I get followed a lot - I don’t know who by, but I think people are still very fascinated by the case. “It’s debilitating for my privacy. “But I don’t feel threatened by it. I’m a very brave individual. “Living through it has been very hard every day with all the pointless court cases. It’s just sort of very time consuming. “People can judge but at the end of the day you really need to look someone in the eyes to understand who they are or what they’re about. “As time goes on, all that remains is the truth, the lies, the speculation and the guesses. “I think there’s a very powerful message in the documentary - that anyone can be the brunt of this force for no reason, or for good reason. “In my case, there was certainly no reason. It was during Covid when nothing else was happening in the news. For people, it was entertaining. For me, it was just a really hard time.” Court documents in 2022 revealed that one senior officer believed Anthony had “likely killed"" his wife. He says: “There was definitely some sense of injustice at the start, but the police ruled me out pretty strongly. ""It was one police officer out of a whole bunch I dealt with who was proud and egotistical and thought he knew everything - but clearly didn’t diagnose my trauma. “So I can’t feel any resentment towards the police whatsoever."" Anthony says he has forced himself to keep going for the sake of Caddick's teenage son, who is now 17 but has lived with him for years. “Being a single dad is full on but I keep going - for him,"" Anthony says. “We don’t really talk about what’s happened, but we do sometimes have a laugh over the funny things - like once when we were in a restaurant and Caddick walked out with a napkin still stuck to her dress. “If I could speak to her now I’d want to tell her that he’s doing really well, and thriving, because I know that would be the most important thing to her.” Anthony and his step-son, who is not named in the documentary, live together in a small flat in Sydney East. It is a meteoric fall from the lavish home they had all lived in previously in Dover Heights, where neighbours included the former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Back then, Caddick owned a Mercedes Benz and Audi convertible, the family would work out in a state-of-the-art home gym and they would dine at the most exclusive restaurants in the city - dripping in diamonds and designer clothes. Now, the ashes from her foot are at Anthony’s home - as yet he can’t bring himself to think of burying her. He says of the family's current finances: “I got left with $1.95 in the end. Everything relating to Melissa was frozen - even if it was things I had given to her. “The one that upsets me most is her engagement ring, which was white gold with a big diamond, because that was something I saved up to give to her. It was bought with my money but still taken away as one of her assets."" Anthony adds: “No one wanted to employ me anymore when the case came up, so I had to hustle to keep a 14 year-old at the time. “I don’t get any government incentives to look after him. It was very hard to get a rental, with my name. Eventually, after 20 goes, I found one. “I built up a freelance hairdresser business with regular clients. I was just very fortunate.” When we get to the subject of Caddick's deception, it is something Anthony clearly wants to distance himself from as much as possible. “I was the most in the dark person out of everyone,” he insists. “I didn’t know. “She had investors working for her every day so I had no reason to question anything.” But surely, when it’s under your nose, you catch a whiff of something untoward? “I’m a very straight, simple person,” he says. “I just make people feel good by fixing their hair up. I didn’t understand the financial industry whatsoever.” He has a good relationship with Caddick's brother, Adam, and her parents Barbara and Ted - often going for dinner. For legal reasons he says he doesn’t speak to other investors who were fleeced. He doesn’t carry the weight of his wife’s crimes on his shoulders - nor does he feel that he himself was a victim of Caddick's deceptions. “I don’t feel she pulled the wool over my eyes, no, because our situation was different from her work one. “What we had was love - and love is more powerful than any money,” he explains. “You can’t replace a human being but you can replace money. “I miss her every day. I miss her smile and holding hands. “We share the same birthday on April 21st and I’ll go for a walk to the places we loved. “But I've got to move forward with my life at some point and I’m sort of trying to get to the stage where I can do that. “I’m not dating - I’m nowhere near that stage of my life yet. I’m just with my boy. “If people expect me to show more emotion and I don’t - that’s because I lost 100 per cent. “I’ve had everything to worry about. There is nothing more I could worry about now.” The Real Vanishing Act: The Missing Millionairess and Vanishing Act is available to stream exclusively on ITVX from today.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reproduced-editorial-purposes-directly-833860035.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/south-sydney-dna-testing-matched-638482689.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/south-sydney-dna-testing-matched-638456939.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/south-sydney-dna-testing-matched-638482690.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reproduced-editorial-purposes-directly-833860012.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reproduced-editorial-purposes-directly-833860081.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/south-sydney-dna-testing-matched-638484824.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reproduced-editorial-purposes-directly-833860007.jpg",My wife Melissa Caddick was a multi-millionaire hiding scandalous secret… I was blamed for her murder when she vanished,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23153435/melissa-caddick-husband-anthony-vanishing-act-millionaire/
"A CHINESE zoo has come under fire after pictures resurfaced of a dog trying to be passed off as a lion. It comes after Hangzhou Zoo was forced to deny claims that one of their sun bears was a human in a costume after footage showed the animal waving at visitors. And now Yuanjiashan Zoo, in the province of Xichang, has faced fresh criticism after a video resurfaced from two years ago. The footage was taken in 2021 after an astonished dad - identified only as Tang - realised a golden retriever had been put inside a lion’s cage. The man filmed the dog sitting patiently within the confined walls of the African lion’s enclosure, having taken his son to see one of the zoo’s top attractions. As reported by the South China Morning Post at the time, a staff member at the zoo explained that the lions had been temporarily moved. And they claimed they hadn't yet got around to changing the signs on the enclosures. But Tang was unconvinced and accused the zoo of passing the golden retriever off as a lion - and claimed they were selling tickets to customers under a false pretence. Tang said: ""The money for the ticket is a small deal. ""What matters [to] me more is that I don't know how to explain the current situation to my kid."" Although the saga happened two years ago, it follows the outrage over the ""human"" sun bear at Hanghzou Zoo. The footage shows Angela the bear stood up on his hind legs and appeared to wave at visitors as it tried to catch food thrown in its direction. But the zoo was quick to shut down the accusations with a bizarre statement made from the bear’s perspective, saying: ""It seems you don’t understand me very well."" Elsewhere, other Chinese zoos have been accused of trying to pass off dogs dyed to look like wolves or African cats. And in 2019 two workers at Yancheng Wild Animal World were seen wearing gorilla costumes and jumping around. It was later passed off as an April Fools' prank by the zoo, following a number of complaints.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lyin-king-chinese-zoo-trying-835823403.jpg,Chinese zoo trying to pass off dog as lion goes viral after ‘human bear costume’ saga,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23327559/chinese-zoo-dog-lion-viral-human-bear/
"VEGAN influencer Zhanna Samsonova boasted that she weighed the same as ""18 coconuts"" before her tragic death. The 39-year-old known as Zhanna D'Art , who is feared to have starved to death , proudly shared on Instagram she weighed just 41kgs after going on an extreme fruit-only diet. The Russian national died while on a tour of south-eastern Asia after catching a ""cholera-like infection,""  just hours before she was due to fly home. Despite concerns from her friends who were worried about her alarmingly low weight, the influencer insisted on sticking to her restrictive diet. Zhanna told her Instagram followers how she spent years eating and drinking just fruits, sunflower seed sprouts, smoothies, and juices. And in one post she was thrilled to announce she weighed 41kgs - the equivalent of 18 coconuts she was holding. Sharing a picture of herself holding a bunch of coconuts, she wrote: ""Being thin doesn't mean weak! Being big and bulky doesn't mean strong! ""Recognise that we all come in different shapes and sizes, and that all people are inherently valuable regardless of the way they look. ""I'm holding the bunch of nine coconuts with just one left hand! ""One coconut is about 2-2.3kg, approximately 18-22kg, and my weight is 41kg by the way."" The influencer's grieving mum Vera Samsonova previously revealed how she begged her to come home during their last phone conversation the day before she died. ""Zhanna, you need to go to Moscow,"" the 63-year-old had pleaded. ""I understood that Zhanna was about to die, but still I could not help her in any way. My daughter's life has turned into a nightmare,"" she told Russian newspaper Novye Izvestiya. In Samsonova's last moments, Vera explained that seemed to have finally understood the errors of her ways and replied: ""Yes, I was so mistaken."" One of her friends, Olga Chernyaeva, told Russian media how Samsonova could barely walk in the months before her death. ""I watched her journey to death for seven years. About five months ago, I met Zhanna in Sri Lanka and she had a haggard look. ""Her legs were swollen... It was amazing that she was still moving - I think she did it through pain."" Chernyaeva added that she was forced to helplessly watch as Samsonova - who refused to get treatment - turned to ""only bones"" and was left bed-bound. ""She was in bed for almost a month. If she got up, it was very difficult for her to walk - it took several minutes to overcome one step of the stairs."" The raw food influencer also had touted online that her body does not ""require"" water. ""I have not drunk water for the last 6 years. This is a common occurrence in those who are on a fruit diet,"" she wrote on Instagram post from last year. ""This is not something that I limit or restrain myself, it's just that my body does not require it,"" she added. Another friend reported how seeing Samsonova several months ago had left her ""horrified"". ""Her hands were like those of my 12-year-old sister, thin,"" they told Russian news outlet 116.ru. ""A few months ago, in Sri Lanka, she already looked exhausted. ""They sent her home to seek treatment. However, she ran away again. When I saw her in Phuket, I was horrified. ""I lived one floor above her and every day I feared finding her lifeless body in the morning. I convinced her to seek treatment, but she didn't make it."" Days before she died, Samsonova shared the haunting last message : ""Life is meaningless but worth living provided you recognise it's meaningless."" The cryptic note written over a selfie with her mouth open came after seven weeks of conspicuous silence on her Instagram . Zhanna's family is waiting for a medical report and a death certificate to show her official cause of death. The Beat Eating Disorders helpline is open 365 days a year.

"A WAGNER fighter allegedly went on a murderous rampage through Russia and killed six people after returning home from the Ukrainian frontline. Cops said the massacre took place in the northwest region of Karelia where two homes were set alight and its occupants brutally stabbed. As a result 37-year-old Igor Sofonov and his pal Maxim Bochkarev, 38, were charged with the alleged murders. Footage showed the hardened thugs being frogmarched through a Russian prison. Both men were remanded in custody for at least two months as investigations continue. It has been reported Sofonov had just returned from Ukraine after being pardoned for his service under Putin's twisted decree . According to the legislation - murderers and sex offenders could all be offered their freedom if they last six months at the frontline. Multiple local reports claimed Sofonov was a former Wagner Group thug who returned to Karelia in spring after he was freed from the war. Both him and Bochkarev reportedly served previous jail time for serious convictions including murder, rape, robbery and drugs. Their arrest comes as cops discovered the bodies of five men and a woman with stab wounds and serious burns after two separate homes were set alight. Local authorities confirmed the blaze happened on August 1, destroying the neighbouring properties in the village of Derevyannoy. Chilling pictures showed the inferno in action as well as the aftermath of the devastated homes. Inside one home, residents Konstantin Lonin, 42, his brother Dmitry, 47, and Vladimir Sergeenko, 76, were all reportedly stabbed to death. A woman named Svetlana, 38, was also killed. At the other premises, cops found the bodies of Vladimir Tereshchenko, 70, and his son Artyom, 39. Local reports said Artyom's children were inside the property and had escaped through the windows when the intruders broke in. The youngsters then alerted their grandfather and Artyom, who approached the scene but were fatefully killed. The horrific incident was said to be sparked by a long-standing conflict on domestic grounds, Karelia News reported. Both alleged suspects were in a state of ""extreme intoxication"" when they were detained, sources claimed. Russian investigators further suggested the two houses were set on fire in a bid to hide the gruesome massacre. It comes as steaming rotten corpses of slain Wagner Group soldiers led to the discovery of a mass grave in Siberia . In February, a fighter in Putin's vicious private army was also arrested after allegedly attacking a police officer following a brawl at a bar.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fighter-putins-war-igor-sofonov-835829373.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/goes-rampage-accomplice-maxim-bochkarev-835829390.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fighter-putins-war-igor-sofonov-835829367.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fighter-putins-war-igor-sofonov-835829387.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fighter-putins-war-igor-sofonov-835829361.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fighter-putins-war-igor-sofonov-835829358.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fighter-putins-war-igor-sofonov-835829363.jpg",Wagner soldier returns to Russia & goes on rampage killing 6 after being freed from prison by Putin to fight in Ukraine,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23324588/wagner-fighter-returns-russia-rampage-killing-freed-ukraine/
"AT least 18 people including children have died after a bus plunged 100ft into a ravine. The bus was carrying dozens of passengers and their families across Mexico and left the road after the driver fell asleep. The horror crash took place in the early hours of Thursday in the north bypass of the city of Tepic. The bus - part of the Elite passenger line - had left Mexico City and was bound for Tijuana, making a stop in Guadalajara. Emergency services attended the scene and rescued at least 20 injured passengers, including the driver, who is under police custody. One woman's condition has been described as ""delicate,"" the state government said. Jorge Benito Rodriguez, security and civil protection secretary for Nayarit, described the rescue as ""extremely difficult"". So far, it is known that five minors have died, local media reported. All injured passengers were transferred to different hospitals in Tepic. Two people from India were also identified among the injured.

"BRITISH fighter jets in charge of defending Nato's eastern flank from Vladimir Putin have intercepted 50 of his warplanes in four months. RAF Typhoons currently based in Estonia have flown more than 500 hours as they led the alliance's air policing operations in a powerful show of force to Russia. Royal Air Force personnel have returned to the UK after a gruelling four month mission to defend the skies over the Baltic against any Russian threats. Members of 140 Expeditionary Air Wing and a squadron of RAF Typhoon fighter jets have been conducting ""Quick Reaction Alert"" intercepts of any potential threats near to Nato airspace. The deployment, named ""Op Azotize"", began with RAF pilots flying missions alongside the German Air Force, which is when the first ever joint air intercept between NATO allies took place . British and German Typhoons shadowed a Russian air-to-air refuelling aircraft and transport aircraft flying between St Petersburg and Kaliningrad. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Hundreds of RAF pilots and personnel have spent months away from their families, working round-the-clock alongside our allies to keep Europe’s skies safe. “The UK’s successful leadership of Nato's air policing mission in Estonia, resulting in the interception of dozens of Russian aircraft by the RAF, sends a strong message to Putin that we stand united with our allies against any threat to our borders.” The fighter jet squadron was always held at a moment's notice - ready to scramble and take on any possible threat in the skies. After taking full leadership of the air policing mission, RAF Typhoons regularly flew QRA missions – intercepting 21 Russian fighters, long-range bombers, and reconnaissance aircraft in just 21 days. Defence Minister Baroness Goldie DL paid tribute to the ""commitment and dedication"" of the  140 Expeditionary Air Wing in protecting Nato airspace. ""The day to day, personal sacrifices made not only by the individuals but also their families in the name of duty are nothing short of commendable,"" she added. While deployed in Estonia, the RAF took place in the largest Nato Air Deployment exercise since the Cold War . In a declared show of force to Putin, the alliance had over 250 aircraft and 10,000 personnel from 25 Nato and partner nations involved in the aerial war games. Last month, The Sun's Jerome Starkey found out what it is like to be intercepted by RAF Typhoons. He was onboard a transport jet as fighters from eight allies blasted into the sky during drills to prepare for a Russian incursion. The jets armed with air-to-air missiles roared up to his plane's wing tips in scenes that echoed the classic film Top Gun. Earlier in July, President Putin’s doomsday jet was intercepted by RAF fighters on a mission over the Baltic Sea. British typhoons closely shadowed the nuclear command and control aircraft as it flew in and out of the Russian city of Kaliningrad - eerily near Nato's borders. In June, the RAF scrambled its fighters to intercept Russian warplanes that were buzzing near to Nato's airspace in a nail-biting mid-air standoff. One thousand British Army soldiers remain stationed at Tapa Army Base in Estonia.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/AZO-20230614-0000-A-Scramble-026-N.jpg.iCee7__WMWATAA._nTEHWrB2Z.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-russian-aircrafts-remained-international-829568529.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Download-10.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Download-9.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RM-RAF-escort-op.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/135eaw-official-20200901-129-151.jpg.iceri_7wmwataa.jqutzb74iv.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raf-typhoon-jets-intercept-nato-829585245.jpg",RAF fighter jets intercept 50 warplanes flying close to Nato airspace in just four months in border showdown with Putin,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23329223/raf-fighter-jets-nato-airspace-border-showdown-putin/
"LOCALS were left spooked after spotting a ""spinning triangle with a fiery thruster"" circling the skies in Cuba. Shocking footage captured the moment the UFO flew over Cerro, Havana , while seemingly ablaze as residents watched on in fear. Even a former US intelligence officer has suggested the bizarre spectacle in broad daylight could potentially be an extraterrestrial . Residents who recorded the extraordinary clip can be heard gasping in sheer disbelief as the mystery object hurtles through the sky. It appears to have a fiery thruster on the back of it which burns at varying intensities. Illuminated by the red-hot glow, the UFO seems to begin tumbling through the air uncontrollably after loitering for a few seconds. The blazing thruster then appears to transform into an unstoppable fireball as it continues to rotate. But the apparent inferno then subsides, instead presenting itself as a spinning line of flames in the chilling video. The shape of the UFO has even been compared to spaceship designs seen in the hit 1996 film Independence Day starring Will Smith . The grainy footage was originally filmed by a gobsmacked local in 2019, but has since resurfaced on social media and has gone viral. Cuban journalist Juan Manuel Cao, 62, shared his thoughts on the strange sighting on his AmericaTeVe Miami channel. He told viewers: ""It’s the closest thing to a flying saucer I’ve ever seen and it’s not a dot in the sky, it’s clearly visible."" Cao invited ex-US Intelligence Officer, Colonel Octavio Pérez, to offer his expert opinion on the possible UFO. He suggested that the unusual aircraft could be using an anti-gravitational system - a feat that has not yet been achieved by humans. Pérez said the fiery ""flying saucer"" may actually be an extraterrestrial, or possibly a spy plane adapted from advanced alien technology . One viewer said: ""At first it looks blurry, but then the object becomes very clear. It is one of the best images I have ever seen."" Another commented: ""Those US military ships using alien technology are everywhere."" The clip has also been applauded by bigwigs in the UFO community across the world. Monterey UFOs wrote: ""Amazing!"" Paranormal Tenerife added: ""This is one of the clips that caught my attention the most. It has a different design to the typical."" It comes as a string of former military officials shared bombshell details on a so-called UFO retrieval program that has allegedly been covered up by the US government. Among the crowd of impassioned whistleblowers was David Grusch, who shared his testimony in front of the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs. He told Congress that the government have a secret UFO scheme and claimed that they are in possession of ""non-human"" spacecraft and ""dead pilots"" .

"A MUM-of-two tragically passed away after drinking four bottles of water in just 20 minutes during a family day out. Ashley Summers, 35, is estimated to have guzzled 64 ounces as she struggled to quench her raging thirst in the stifling heat. The family, from Indiana , US , had been exploring Lake Freeman while celebrating the Fourth of July weekend last month. But Ashley began complaining of a headache and other symptoms of dehydration such as feeling lightheaded on the last day of their trip. The mum said that no amount of water seemed to satiate her thirst, seeing her knock back the equivalent of four 500ml bottles. Her brother, Devon Miller, told WRTV : ""I mean, an average water bottle is like 16 ounces, so that was 64 ounces that she drank in a span of 20 minutes. ""That’s half a gallon. That’s what you’re supposed to drink in a whole day."" Ashley then returned home with her husband and two young daughters, but suddenly collapsed in their garage. She was rushed to the Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital with severe brain swelling - but sadly never regained consciousness. Devon explained: ""My sister, Holly, called me, and she was just an absolute wreck. She was like ‘Ashley is in the hospital'. ""'She has brain swelling, they don’t know what’s causing it, they don’t know what they can do to get it to go down, and it’s not looking good'."" Doctors diagnosed the mum with water toxicity , also known as hyponatremia, which is caused by low salt levels in the blood. It can occur when too much water is drunk over a short period of time, diluting the sodium levels in the body. This overwhelms the ability of the body's complex organ systems, primarily the kidneys, to regulate the balance of fluids. Symptoms include feeling generally unwell, as well as having muscle cramps, soreness, nausea, vomiting and headaches. In serious cases, the brain can swell, which can lead to confusion, seizures, coma and death. Her heartbroken brother continued: ""It was a big shock to us all. I was just like, this is a thing?' ""She just felt like she couldn't get enough water. ""When they left the sand bar to when they got to the dock, it was about a 20-minute boat ride. ""She drank four bottles of water in that 20 minutes."" Toxicologist Dr Blake Froberg explained that cases of water toxicity are more likely throughout the summer . He said those who work up a thirst by working outside or exercising frequently have a higher likelihood of suffering from the fatal illness. Dr Froberg said: ""There are certain things that can make someone more at risk for it, but the overall thing that happens is that you have too much water and not enough sodium in your body."" The expert urged people to drink liquids that contain electrolytes, sodium and potassium to regulate their body. Ashley was an organ donor, meaning her heart, liver, kidneys and some of her long bone tissue were donated to save five other lives. The family were visiting Lake Freeman, situated around 80 miles north of Indianapolis, for a weekend holiday boat excursion. Ashley and her loved ones ""loved being on the water"", Devon said. They had arrived at the tourist hotpot on July 1 until July 4.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/family-pain-mum-of-two-835860596.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/family-pain-mum-of-two-835860598.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/family-pain-mum-of-two-835860603.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/family-pain-mum-of-two-835860599.jpg",Mum dies from ‘water poisoning’ after drinking 4 bottles in 20 minutes while on family day out and getting swollen brain,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23333744/mum-dies-water-poisoning-drinking-4-bottles-20-minutes/
"CHILDREN sobbed and screamed in fear as a terrifying brawl broke out on the streets of Benidorm between a man and a topless tourist. Footage captured the moment rowdy holidaymakers came to blows in the holiday hotspot beloved by Brits in the early hours of July 20. The ""brutal"" bust-up is said to have unfolded in front of several kids, who were shoved out of the way as the altercation escalated. Shocking video shows a shirtless man in grey shorts being held back by a blonde woman wearing a blue dress who is trying to calm tensions. But he pushes her out of his path just seconds later and charges towards another bloke wearing a white t-shirt and khaki shorts. The thug is then seen reigning down a number of powerful punches as onlookers desperately scream: ""Stop it!"" The brawling pair are then momentarily separated by passersby, while another woman asks: ""You did that in front of your kids?"" ""Listen, the kids are screaming,"" another person yells. One woman is seen attempting to shield at least two children from the violence as they watch on nervously from the pavement. After a momentary lull in the chaos, the man in the white t-shirt then seeks revenge on his shirtless attacker and appears to strike him in the face. Further blood-curdling screams follow, while the group continue to row in the street. An eye-witness told the Daily Star one of the men had been heard arguing on the phone prior to the scuffle in the holiday hotspot. He is said to have told his rival: ""Meet me on the f***ing corner you c***."" The anonymous onlooker said: ""It is not pretty to watch as a parent. ""He ran over there, pushed the kids out the way, smacked the bloke and knocked him out. ""They were scrapping, the kids were screaming, it was brutal. Gives Benidorm a bad name."" It is currently unclear if Benidorm cops are investigating the street brawl. Spanish officials are on a mission to stamp out booze-fuelled violence and drunken antics that plague the party-loving city . New rules have been introduced in parts of the country in recent years to tackle what the authorities called ""the tourism of excesses"". Authorities aimed to crack down on public nudity, drinking, sex acts and anti-social behaviour. In June last year, a pair of randy tourists caught romping against a bin were seen being whacked with truncheons by cops. We previously told how a Benidorm expert shared his survival guide for tourists to stay out of trouble with the law .

"UKRAINE has unleashed a sea drone attack today on the key Russian port and naval base Novorossiysk. Dramatic footage shows a drone burning before exploding in the harbour sparking a massive fireball. While a different video showed the Russian naval landing Olenegorsky Gornya being towed towards the harbour after it sustained significant damage. The blast in the port was seen, some 450 nautical miles, from the Kyiv-held waters where the drone was likely launched. Vladimir Putin’s forces deployed two warships to counter the strikes . Ship movements in key port Novorossiysk - the second largest Russian -run after St Petersburg - were halted amid the drone strikes and sound of gunfire. Two Russian naval vessels - landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak and anti-sabotage boat Suvorovets - were deployed to shoot at the incoming surface drones . Locals reported seeing ""a bright flash over the sea and explosions"". This was close to the facilities of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, a major international oil pipeline system which delivers oil from western Kazakhstan to Black Sea terminals at  Novorossiysk. Explosions were reported after midnight and also closer to dawn as Russian air defences worked. The Russian defence ministry said its forces had repelled two drone strikes in Novorossiysk. It said in a statement: ""Two unmanned sea boats attempted to attack the Novorossiysk naval base. “During the repulse of the attack, unmanned boats were visually detected and destroyed by fire from the standard weapons of Russian ships guarding the outer raid of the naval base.” Mayor Andrei Kravchenko said: “Today military units have worked effectively to protect our hero city. “Our servicemen are technically provided with everything necessary to perform their tasks. “All life support and logistics facilities are under reliable protection.” Meanwhile, loud explosions were heard in Russian-held Crimea as Ukraine staged a nighttime attack on an oil depot in Feodosia. Russians said they faced 13 drones and had shot down ten with three more disabled by electronic warfare jamming. Pro-Russian sources said this was ""air defences shooting down enemy drones in the Crimean town of Feodosia"" The Russian defence ministry said: ""An attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack by aircraft-type UAVs on objects on the territory of the Crimean peninsula was thwarted. “Ten drones were destroyed by air defence on duty. Three more enemy drones were suppressed by means of electronic warfare."" The attack follows a series of strikes from air and sea Russia has faced lately as Kyiv vowed to bring the war close to Putin's doorstep. In the so-called "" War of the Drones "", Ukraine has been fighting back with increased vigour and equipment, launching 120 suspected strikes deep into Russia in only six months. The latest hit comes just days after a hit by HIMARS missiles in the Kherson region left hundreds of Russian soldiers dead. It is claimed that up to 200 of Vladimir Putin 's men were on the occupied Dzharylhach Island when the strikes occurred. Drone footage shows infantry troops apparently training in separate groups just moments before explosions engulfed the shoreline.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/81e003c8-8c63-40c9-aae2-1ffdf92d6120.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/63464b17-6532-4000-92ba-8c08ff350bb2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/olenegorsky-gornyak-landing-ship-835954499.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/grab1-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/grab5-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/7524e933-8624-461f-95cd-1acf78874153.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6135876f-874d-4199-9f7a-110b34056c26.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/suvorovets-anti-sabotage-boat-835954529.jpg",Russian warship blown up by kamikaze Ukrainian drone leaving massive hole in side in latest humiliating blow to Putin,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23279570/ukraine-sea-drone-blast-naval-base/
"A TOURIST bus carrying 53 passengers burst into flames on a motorway in Gran Canaria. Firefighters spent 40 minutes putting the blaze out and evacuating passengers from the burning bus. Shocking footage shows heavy black smoke rising into the sky on the Spanish island as other drivers watched in horror at the sight. The GC-1 motorway near to Salobre in San Bartolomé de Tirajana was temporarily closed as the violent fire raged yesterday. There are no current reports of injuries and all passengers are believed to to have been evacuated safely. After the blaze was put out, firefighters continued to douse the bus with water to avoid it reigniting, while highways services cleared the road. Footage from the aftermath shows a still smouldering and completely burnt-out shell of the bus. Later scenes show the bus sitting on a sheet of foam produced by the fire extinguishers. It is not known how the fire started. It comes only days after another tourist coach packed with children plunged off a mountain road in Spain leaving 19 people injured. The bus was en route to a popular national park in the northern Spanish region of Asturias when the horror accident happened. Last week, two people were killed after a bus smashed into a ditch near Paris .

"A RAPPER who calls herself the "" Crocodile of Wall Street"" and her tech entrepreneur husband have pleaded guilty to trying to launder £3.5billion worth of Bitcoin . Heather Morgan, 32, and Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein, 34, were accused of laundering the cryptocurrency fortune in Bitcoin after the Bitfinex exchange was hacked in 2016. At the time of their arrest in February last year, the stash of 119,000 Bitcoins was worth about $4.5bn - making it the US Department of Justice's largest single financial seizure in its history. As part of a plea deal, Lichtenstein, a dual citizen of Russia and the US, admitted he was behind the hack. The couple pleaded guilty to money laundering, but Morgan pleaded guilty to an additional count of conspiracy to defraud the United States . They both now face prison sentences - with Lichtenstein in line for a possible maximum of 20 years in prison and Morgan a potential ten. While evading police, Morgan pretended to be a rapper and tech entrepreneur. Together with her husband, the New York couple loved sharing their high-roller lifestyle online. Morgan - who goes by the stage name Razzlekhan - calls herself ""the infamous Crocodile of Wall Street "" who is ""more fearless and more shameless than ever before"" on her website. In articles published in Forbes, she also claimed to be a successful tech businesswoman, calling herself an ""economist, serial entrepreneur, software investor and rapper"". But while developing Morgan's rapping and tech persona, the couple cashed out their crypto fortune into traditional money using sophisticated techniques to try to stay under the radar. According to court papers , the pair split up the Bitcoin into tiny amounts and transferred it to thousands of different crypto wallets with fake identities, and mixed their stolen funds with other criminal cryptocurrencies on the darknet marketplace Alphabay. They also purchased gold coins and set up shell companies to make the Bitcoin funds look legitimate. But one of their key mistakes was shopping with Walmart supermarket vouchers paid for with the stolen funds. ""Police were able to link the Walmart gift cards back to some of the proceeds of the Bitfinex hack, which then opened up the further investigation,"" said Jonathan Levin, founder of cryptocurrency investigators Chainalysis which was involved in the investigation. ""Buying gift cards and moving between different exchanges and different cryptocurrency never actually created this sort of break in provenance that the couple intended,"" he said. “Bitfinex will work with the DOJ and follow appropriate legal processes to establish our rights to a return of the stolen bitcoin,” Bitfinex said in a written statement. When raiding the couple's Manhattan home, cops found hollowed-out books created to hide mobile phones. They also discovered dozens of burner handsets, several USB sticks and $40,000 in cash. In court documents, prosecutors say they uncovered communication records that indicate Morgan and Lichtenstein were planning to flee the US for Russia - his country of birth. If successful, they would have probably lived a billionaire lifestyle, safe from arrest by the US, the BBC reports. Lichtenstein has worked as a tech entrepreneur and describes himself in online profiles as an ""angel investor."" He got engaged to Morgan in 2019, according to their Facebook posts. “I got engaged to my best friend and the woman of my dreams!” Lichtenstein wrote.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crypto-croc-rapper-dubs-crocodile-710541500.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crypto-croc-rapper-dubs-crocodile-835972869.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/timesgrab-youtube-image-shows-crypto-710592081.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crocodile-wall-street-rapper-stole-835977228-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/heather-morgans-husband-ilya-lichtenstein-761129983.jpg",How ‘Crocodile of Wall Street’ rapper stole £3.5BILLION worth of Bitcoin in ‘crypto heist of the century’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23336869/wall-street-rapper-stole-3-5billion-bitcoin-crypto-heist/
"CONTROVERSIAL influencer Andrew Tate has been released from house arrest, pending a trial, a Romanian court has ruled. The former kickboxer , 36, has won an appeal in court in Bucharest and is set to be placed under judicial control - a similar measure to bail. The Bucharest Court of Appeals said in a written ruling that it ""replaces the house arrest measure with that of judicial control for a period of 60 days from August 4 until October 2."" The ruling means that Tate, his brother Tristan and suspects Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu can leave the house, but not the capital and the surrounding Ilfov county. His spokesperson Mateea Petrescu clarified that Tate will not be allowed to be ""in close proximity with any of the other defendants, any of the witnesses or any of the alleged victims and their immediate family."" ""This positive outcome gives us confidence that more favourable developments are on the horizon,"" he added. Under Romanian law, a judge has 60 days to inspect the case files to ensure legality. The trial will not start until that process is completed. A prosecution source told The Sun said they were frustrated with the decision, saying: ""House arrest would have been more suitable in this case."" ""They are a public threat to society,"" they said. ""The measure of judicial control means that the Tate brothers will have a lot of freedom, including to spread their aggressive views because they are not banned from posting on social media or making phone calls."" Following the decision, Tate tweeted: ""After 10 months. 3 in jail, 7 at home. After 15 million euro of asset seizures. ""After an inditement based on nothing. ""The file was passed to a Judge who has ruled it weak and circumstantial. ""I have been released from house arrest but must remain within Romania. Now. To the Mosque. Alhamdulillah."" While his brother Tristan hit back at ""haters"" posting: ""Judges have release me from house arrest. It doesn’t matter how many fake screenshots haters share on X. ""Imagine having spent 2 years running an account showing old videos saying I’m 'guilty'. Losers. Justice is justice. ""The law is the law. Evidence is evidence. I am free."" Tate previously lost a series of appeals against a judge's decision to be kept on house arrest . Last month a court ruled the duo should remain under house arrest for 30 more days over sex trafficking claims . Tate immediately launched a furious rant against the judges' ruling on Twitter , claiming: ""They’ve just decided I must remain on house arrest into month 8 - this can continue indefinitely."" ""I haven’t been outside in 7 months,"" he added. The brothers have spent the past five months on house arrest in their £600,000 compound on the outskirts of the Romanian capital. The court 's decision comes after the disgraced influencer sparked outrage after he posted a misogynistic comment to Amanda Holden 's bikini snap. The influencer shared Amanda's photo where she poses in a black string bikini while on holiday and wrote:  ""You are a wife and a mother and you're far past a teenager. ""There is no need for this post."" The two brothers were arrested in December. after they were accused of recruiting women on social media platforms and persuading them to travel to their on the outskirts of Bucharest. Andrew has also been charged with rape and Tristan has been charged with instigating others to violence. The indictment says the two brothers alongside Naghel and Radu formed an organised criminal group in 2021 for human trafficking in Romania . Prosecutors allege seven female victims were recruited by Tate through false promises of marriage or a relationship, known as the ""loverboy method"". Under Romanian law, trafficking of adults carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years. But it is understood the trial is expected to take several years. Andrew and Tristan strongly deny all charges against them and have been fighting to be released ever since. The duo were released from the hellhole jail after winning an appeal to be moved to house arrest in March. In June, Romania's Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT). had requested that judges extend the house arrest measure after the agency filed its investigation. Tate, who has been accused of peddling conspiracy theories online and has amassed 7 million Twitter followers, has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors have no evidence against him and that there is a political conspiracy designed to silence his views. There are seven female victims in the case, DIICOT said, who were lured with false pretences of love and transported to Romania, where the gang sexually exploited and subjected them to physical violence. One defendant is accused of raping a woman twice in March 2022, according to the agency. The women were allegedly controlled by “intimidation, constant surveillance” and claims they were in debt, prosecutors said. Andrew Tate was previously banned from several prominent social media platforms for expressing hate speech and misogynistic comments, including that women should bear responsibility for getting sexually assaulted. Several women in Britain also are pursuing civil claims to obtain damages from Tate, alleging they were victims of sexual violence. In his bombshell interview with the BBC, the influencer claimed one of his alleged victims was ""imaginary"" and ""doesn't exist"" as he insisted the legal case against him has been ""utterly fabricated."" After he dominated the chat, the BBC chose to finish the interview abruptly.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inquiry-charges-human-trafficking-intention-836008277.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inquiry-charges-human-trafficking-intention-835473532.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inquiry-charges-human-trafficking-intention-836008268.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/andrew-tate-left-brother-tristan-832305351.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-prosecutors-seized-several-luxury-788467467-1.jpg",Andrew Tate RELEASED from house arrest by Romanian courts pending trial over sex trafficking charges,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23336427/andrew-tate-released-house-arrest-pending-trial/
"DRAMATIC new footage onboard a Ukrainian kamikaze drone shows the exact moment it hit a Russian warship at dawn this morning. The marine drone, packed with a 450kg of TNT explosives, attacked the ship at Novorossiysk naval base in a humiliating blow to Vladimir Putin. The video shows the alleged SBU Ukrainian intelligence sea drone zooming towards the unsuspecting Russian ship in the cover of darkness. The video then cuts out as it appears to hit the warship believed to be either the Olenegorsky Miner or Olenegorsky Gornyak. It was said to be carrying a payload of 450kg of TNT and, according to reports, the strike rendered the warship unable to perform combat tasks. In the aftermath of the marine drone attack, the vessel looks half-sunk as it sits awkwardly low and tilted in the water in Russia's second largest port. The Russian navy sought to save it by towing the damaged vessel into dock. Russian state media stuck to earlier false reports that the drone attack on Novorossiysk was successfully repulsed - a claim undermined by the PoV video. The suspected Ukrainian attack was allegedly orchestrated by both Ukraine's intelligence services and its navy. A Ukrainian intelligence source told Interfax-Ukraine that: ""The special operation was carried out together with the Navy. ""As a result of the attack, the 'Olenegorsky Miner' suffered a serious hole and is currently unable to perform its combat tasks. All Russian statements about the 'attack being repulsed' are fake."" The source added: ""The video shows how a surface drone of the SBU, saturated with 450 kilograms of TNT, attacks an enemy ship with about 100 crew members on board."" Other footage from the drone attacks shows a huge explosion in the harbour that sparked a massive fireball. The blast in the Black Sea port was seen, some 450 nautical miles, from the Kyiv-held waters where the drone was likely launched. Vladimir Putin’s forces deployed two warships to counter the strikes. Ship movements in key port Novorossiysk - the second largest Russian-run after St Petersburg - were halted amid the drone strikes and sound of gunfire. Two Russian naval vessels - landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak and anti-sabotage boat Suvorovets - were deployed to shoot at the incoming surface drones. Locals reported seeing ""a bright flash over the sea and explosions"". This was close to a major international oil pipeline system which delivers oil from western Kazakhstan to Black Sea terminals at Novorossiysk. Explosions were reported after midnight and also closer to dawn as Russian air defences worked. Meanwhile, loud explosions were heard in Russian-occupied Crimea as Ukraine staged a nighttime attack on a second port.

"HOLIDAYMAKERS wait for the blow of a referee’s whistle before battling each other in a frantic race to grab a sunbed. Footage from the three-star Parasol Garden hotel in Torremolinos, near Málaga, Spain , shows scores of tourists waiting anxiously for the signal. The early morning rush at this Costa del Sol hotel has taken the European summer sunbed wars to a whole new level. Hilarious footage shows the holidaymakers poised and ready for the struggle - itching to bag the best spot. And when hotel staff finally give the OK and blow the whistle, it’s every man, woman and child for themselves as they dash towards the prized plastic perches. The lucky ones manage to secure a lounger and then drag the hefty piece of furniture to their favoured positions to soak up the rays. One man is even seen lobbing his towel ahead of him in a bid to claim a prime poolside spot. A lady is seen crest-fallen as she discovers she was too late to the party and walks away without a bed for the day. It comes as The Sun detailed the civil war breaking out across the Med as sun-starved Brits battle each other for the best spots by pools and beaches. British tourists in popular destinations such as Spain , the Balearic Islands and Turkey are going to extreme measures to bag the best sun loungers. They include queuing from 5.30am to wait for pool areas to open hours later, and heading to beaches at the crack of dawn to reserve areas with towels. Sun readers have even caught fellow countrymen and women claiming sun loungers at 11.30pm the night before to ensure they have a prime location to catch some rays. However, residents of popular holiday islands in Greece are trying to initiate a crackdown on the sunbed wars. The so-called ""Towel Movement"" campaign is demanding an end to the pandemonium and wants to ""reclaim the beaches"" from the loungers that plague them. One holidaymaker is so concerned about the spiralling sunbed wars that she is packing her own lounger — in a suitcase. Laura Jayne Lowe, 31, is heading to a hotel in the resort town of Torremolinos, Málaga , where fraught tourists have been queuing from 5.30am to claim a sunbed . Meanwhile, proud sunbed hogger Mel Selton told The Sun exactly how she secures the best spots to top up her tan. The 28-year-old hairdresser from Warrington , Cheshire , says she and her pals make sure they set their alarms early and dash down to the pool to state their claim - and don’t care if people call them selfish . Last month, a British tourist recorded the hilarious moment revved up holidaymakers broke out of their gated pen and raced to bag the best sun lounger spot. Other hotel guests filmed and gawked at the ""unbelievable"" sunbed war spectacle raging beneath them in Ayia Napa . Have you witnessed any sunbed wars on your holiday this year?

"BRIT holidaymakers have been warned to stay away from four popular beaches amid a red flag alert. Cala Mayor, Can Pere Antoni, Ciudad Jardin and Cala Estancia were closed to visitors after heavy rainfall hit Majorca overnight. Little to almost no tourists were spotted by the shore on Friday morning - perhaps wondering if they should have stayed in England. For others, the stormy weather came as a fresh break from the intense Spanish heat. In Majorca, Palma University marked the heaviest rainfall on the island, with 17 litres per square metre overnight. Portocolom and Alfàbia tied with 16 litres per square metre. Campos, Salines and Andratx followed with 15, 14 and 13 litres respectively. Puerto Pollensa marked only seven litres per square metre, but the town is set to be hit by a storm in the next few days. Ibiza beat Majorca with at least 72 litres of rain per square metre falling at Ibiza airport. The unsettled weather is expected to continue throughout the weekend, according to the Met Office. But sunshine and a rise in temperatures are set to return from Monday, Majorca Daily Bulletin reports. The weather alert comes hours after the Carlotti Cove in Santa Pola and Playa de las Villas de Pilar de la Horadada, in Alicante, were closed until the water is deemed suitable for swimming. Officials say they are working to reopen the beaches, Las Provincias reported. ""There has been a failure in the pump that drives the water collected in Santa Pola del Este to the treatment plant and the automaton that should have issued the notice to the EPSAR managers,"" said town councillor for Infrastructure, Trini Ortiz, in a statement. In July, swimmers were also banned from two beaches in Spain after ""abnormal"" levels of bacteria were detected in the water. Authorities closed Urbanova and San Gabriel beaches in Alicante as they analysed the bacteria.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/spain-balearic-islands-majorca-magaluf-836016799.jpg,Four popular Majorca beaches shut down as Brit holidaymakers told to stay away in red flag alert,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23346691/four-popular-majorca-beaches-shut-down-red-flag-alert/
"BRITISH troops have joined key allies in a huge land, sea and air exercise taking place above the south Pacific known as ""Operation Talisman Sabre"". The war games between the UK, US , Australia and 10 other nations are designed to be a major show of force to an increasingly aggressive China . Over 34,000 troops took part in Talisman Sabre, which began on 22 July and ends today. It is the largest military exercise between Australian, UK and US forces and is intended to strengthen partnerships and ready allied armies for any threats in the Indo-Pacific. The war games also involved armed forces from Canada , Fiji, France , Germany , Indonesia, Japan , New Zealand , Papua New Guinea, South Korea , and Tonga. Our troops from the Army, Royal Navy and RAF were involved in the event, enacting drills with many of the same partners that supported the evacuation effort from Sudan in April. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Security and stability throughout the Indo-Pacific is essential. ""Exercise Talisman Sabre demonstrates the UK’s commitment to the region and the strength of our ties with friends and allies.” British Royal Marine Commandos had been busy showing off their ship to shore landings - preparing themselves for any impending crisis. Major Aran Sandiford, Commanding Officer of the Commando Forces, said the exercise is a major opportunity for troops to ""share tactics and practice"" with allies. He added: ""Deploying Commandos into the Indo-Pacific is one of the best ways of demonstrating the Royal Navy’s continued commitment to the region.” Last week, four Australian Army soldiers were killed when their helicopter smashed into the sea during the war drills. The MRH 90 Taipan chopper crashed into the ocean off Hamilton Island in the Whitsundays on July 28. Captain Daniel Lyon, Lieutenant Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class Two Joseph Laycock, and Corporal Alexander Naggs were named as the men involved in the crash. Australia's Deputy prime minister Richard Marles said: “This accident makes very clear what this exercise means, the dangers that are involved, the risks that inevitably come with it."" To the dead servicemen, he added: ""We owe all of you an enormous debt of gratitude.” The allied show of force against China comes as tensions heat up in the region. Self-ruled Taiwan is at the centre of rising tensions in east Asia and have contributed to a recent decision by Japan to boost its defence spending. Meanwhile, the threat of war between China and the US grows by the day over the fate of the island nation of 23 million. Washington has continuously sided with their ally as they face increasing military aggression from Beijing. Xi Jinping regards the self-governing island as part of its territory and said any moves it takes towards full-scale independence will lead to an invasion. The visit of US politician Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in 2022 prompted a furious response from Beijing, with Chinese warships and fighter jets surrounding the island in massive military exercises. Since then, China has revved-up its war games in the region, often encircling Taiwan, invading their air space and simulating missile attacks on its cities. Earlier this year, Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed earlier this month that China's President Xi Jinping is a bigger threat than Russia's Vladimir Putin. Pompeo went as far as to say Xi's ""vicious objective"" is to achieve total dominance across the world.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/british-armed-forces-take-part-836019975.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/british-armed-forces-take-part-836019816.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/british-armed-forces-take-part-836021958.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/british-armed-forces-take-part-836019763.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/british-armed-forces-take-part-836022050.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/british-armed-forces-take-part-836019818.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/british-armed-forces-take-part-836021957.jpg","Brit troops join war games ‘Operation Talisman Sabre’ with 34k soldiers, warships & jets in major show of force to China",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23346730/british-talisman-sabre-war-games-china/
"VLADIMIR Putin's leading political foe has been jailed for another 19 years - his third and longest prison term. Defiant Alexei Navalny, 47, may now remain incarcerated until he is 71, as the Kremlin dictator reaches the age of 95. The anti-war opposition leader - already serving an 11 year sentence for fraud, contempt of court and a parole violation, seen around the world as politically motivated - predicted yesterday that he would be handed down a term of 18 years. The new charges against the politician relate to the activities of Navalny's anti-corruption foundation and statements by his top associates. In 2021, Russian authorities outlawed the foundation and the vast network of Navalny's offices in Russian regions as extremist organizations, exposing anyone involved to possible prosecution. One of Navalny's associates, Daniel Kholodny, is standing trial alongside him after being relocated from a different prison. The prosecution has asked to sentence Kholodny to 10 years in prison. Navalny has rejected all the charges against him as politically motivated and accused the Kremlin of seeking to keep him behind bars for life. On the eve of the verdict hearing, Navalny released a statement on social media, presumably through his team, in which he said he expected his latest sentence to be huge a Stalinist term, referring to the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. In the statement, he called on Russians to personally resist and encouraged them to support political prisoners, distribute flyers or go to a rally. Navalny told Russians that they could choose a safe way to resist, but he added that there is shame in doing nothing and be intimidated. ""My number one request - when the [sentence] is heard, please do not show solidarity with me with lamentations and exclamations [that it is] ‘like under Stalin’,"" he said. ""Better show solidarity with me and other political prisoners by thinking for a minute. ""Think about why such an exponentially huge period is needed. ""Its main purpose is to intimidate. You, not me.” He told followers: “Putin should not achieve his goal.” “There is no shame in choosing the safest way to counter, but it's embarrassing to do nothing,” he said. The politician is currently serving his sentence in a maximum-security prison Penal Colony No. 6 in the town of Melekhovo, more than 140 miles east of Moscow . He has spent months in a tiny one-person cell , also called a punishment cell, for purported disciplinary violations, such as an alleged failure to properly button his prison clothes, appropriately introduce himself to a guard or to wash his face at a specified time. In April, Navalny suffered mystery stomach aches and ""seizures"" amid fears he is being slowly poisoned to death after he lost 18lbs in just days. On social media, Navalny's associates have urged supporters to come to Melekhovo on Friday to express solidarity with the politician. About 40 supporters from different Russian cities gathered outside the colony in Melekhovo on Friday, one of them told The Associated Press in the messaging app Telegram . Yelena, who spoke on condition that her last name is withheld for safety reasons, said the supporters weren't allowed into the colony, but decided to stay outside until the verdict as announced. ""People think it's important to be nearby at least like that, for moral support. We will be waiting,"" she said. The prosecution has asked the court, if it convicts Navalny, to order the politician to serve any new prison term in a special regime penal colony, a term that refers to the Russian prisons with the highest level of security and the harshest inmate restrictions. Russian law stipulates that only men given life sentences or especially dangerous recidivists"" are sent to those types of prisons. The country has many fewer special regime colonies compared to other types of adult prisons, according to state penitentiary service data: 35 colonies for dangerous recidivists and six for men imprisoned for life. Maximum-security colonies are the most widespread type, with 251 currently in operation.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2l-listens-verdict-series-extremism-836029868.jpg,Putin foe Alexei Navalny sentenced to another 19 YEARS in Russian penal colony on ‘bogus’ terrorism charges,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23353241/putin-foe-alexei-navalny-sentenced-to-another-19-years/
"A MAN was left stunned when he woke up and found a mystery deposit of £51,000 in his bank account - but he was rewarded for doing the right thing. The HSBC customer from Sydney , Australia, made the shocking discovery while randomly checking his banking app last week. He reported the jaw-dropping transaction to the bank through their online chat app after fighting the urge to hold onto the ""life-changing"" amount. ""It was pretty tempting to do something dodgy, I'm not going to lie. But a quick Google search saying it's a crime was enough for me,"" he told Yahoo News Australia. ""[I] brought myself back to reality that this is too good to be true and I won't be keeping that money."" According to money.co.uk , if a sum of money is accidentally paid into your bank or savings account and you know it doesn't belong to you, then you must pay it back. They state that keeping this money could lead to you being charged with ""retaining wrongful credit"" and even if you go out and splash the cash, you will be liable to pay it back anyway. The bloke said that when he first saw the mega-figure in his banking app, he thought he had lost £51,000 from being hacked - but quickly realised ""it was actually the reverse"". He took screenshots of his interaction with the HSBC representative which showed him informing the bank of the bizarre error. The worker on the app said the transaction sounded ""so worrying"" before looking into it. He soon received an email from the Head of Mortgage Services at HSBC Australia , Tim Mozsny, who assured the man that the payment ""dispute"" would be resolved. It is believed the Aussie had received an incorrect cash-back transaction which was followed up the next day with a £4.90 cash advance surcharge. He also revealed that he later discovered a £50 credit which he guessed was a""thank you"" from the party who initially made the transfer. The man took to social media to post about the mind-blowing transfer but warned others that the situation wasn't as dreamy as some people may think. He said: ""Woke up to £51k transferred into my bank account. ""It was a blissful and magnificent feeling to suddenly have £51k+ in your bank account but overall quite annoying, would not recommend"". An HSBC spokesperson told Mail Online that they could not comment on individual account matters due to client confidentiality. ""If customers believe an error has been made in regards to their accounts, we ask them to contact our dedicated customer service team,"" they said. This comes after one man was accidentally paid £127,000 into his bank account and was later jailed after refusing to hand any of the cash back. Another dad got the surprise of his life when he opened up his bank account to find he had been paid almost £50billion .",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836027254.jpg,"I woke to find mystery deposit of £51,000 in my bank account – I was rewarded for doing right thing and giving cash back",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23349953/find-mystery-deposit-bank-account-rewarded/
"A PET lover was horrified when he realised his two poodles were actually ferrets pumped with drugs. The anonymous individual, from Catamarca, Argentina was lured into the scam after learning he would only have to pay $150 (£117) for the pair of miniature canines. However, he quickly realised that he would be the one to have his tail between his legs after taking his ‘dogs’ to the vet for their vaccinations. Once there, it was quickly revealed that the owner had purchased what Argentinians call ‘Brazilian rats’. The animals turned out to be two ferrets that had been given steroids at birth in order to increase their size, while extra grooming had ensured their coats would resemble that of a fluffy poodle. Toy poodles are known for their intelligence and are described as sweet, cheerful, perky and lively and love to be around people. But due to a toy poodle’s small stature of no more than 10 inches, it doesn’t take much for a six inch ferret to bulk up to a similar size under the influence of injected drugs. And unfortunately for the man, he fell for the cheap scam at the giant La Salada market, alongside another woman who had been told that she was buying a Chihuahua - only to end up with a ferret. A number of animal scam stories have come out of the woodwork of late following the ‘fake’ sun bear ordeal in China last month. Visitors have been flocking to Hangzhou zoo in eastern China to see a strange-looking bear that has gone viral online following speculation that it is actually a man in a costume. The sun bear, named Angela, was filmed standing on her hind legs and ‘waving’ her arms at onlookers, while her unflattering saggy skin resembled that of a baggy costume. Elsewhere in China, Yuanjiashan Zoo was accused of trying to pass off a golden retriever as a lion after footage resurfaced of the animal sat within the confines of the big cat’s enclosure. However, the zoo claimed they hadn't yet got around to changing the signs on the enclosures, having moved the lions to a different area.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fee18977-bbe4-40b9-b113-88c45c667914.jpg,Giant rodents pumped with steroids sold as POODLES for £100 in baffling cut price pedigree scam,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23345800/giant-rodents-steroids-poodles-scam/
A BRITISH holidaymaker has been found floating dead in the sea off a popular Ibizan holiday cove. The 33-year-old is believed to have drowned although a police investigation will now be carried out to determine the cause of death. The alarm was raised this afternoon after the man was spotted apparently lifeless in the water at upmarket Cala Jondal in the municipality of San Jose in the south-west of the island . Lifeguards got him to a nearby boat and tried to revive him before emergency responders took over after reaching the scene. There was nothing they could do to save him and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Emergency services were alerted around 3.15pm on Friday. It was not immediately clear if the dead man was alone or with friends or family. The attempts to revive him before he was pronounced dead are said to have lasted around 40 minutes. Police could not be reached for comment this afternoon but are expected to make a statement later. Kate Middleton’s uncle Gary Goldsmith is still believed to own a mansion called Maison de Bang Bang at Cala Jondal. Kate and William once enjoyed a romantic getaway at the villa. The popular cove is also home to famous beach restaurants like Blue Marlin.,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dc5d59-group-people-beach-jondal-836038230.jpg,"Brit tourist, 33, found dead floating in sea in Ibiza near luxury villas once used by Prince William and Kate",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23356235/brit-tourist-dead-ibiza-prince-william-and-kate/
"THE desperate British family of a top economist who vanished without trace in Turkey have put up a £30,000 reward for information which leads to his return. Fit and healthy former bank chief Korhan Berzeg , 83, and his dog Tina never returned from their morning walk near his holiday home 50 days ago. His distraught wife Angela, 80, yesterday issued an anguished appeal for help - backed by a reward of one million Turkish Lira as the mystery deepened further. A police search by more than 300 officers backed by dogs, drones and helicopters found no trace of Korhan or Tina after repeatedly scouring vast areas of Gonen in western Turkey. Korhan worked for the US and Saudi governments before his high-flying career ended and has links to some of Turkey’s most powerful money men. Wife of 52 years Angela from Blandford, Dorset said: ""We will give a reward of 1 million TL to the person who finds Korhan alive. I am still hopeful - I have hope that we will find Korhan safe. “Please help me find Korhan. We've always been a very happy family. We've never had a problem with anyone - I want to go back to our happy days.” “We can't sleep, we don't eat, we don't drink. This uncertainty is very difficult.” The economics guru’s baffling disappearance and powerful past in government associations have fuelled a host of dark conspiracy theories. Grandad-of-three Korhan and Angela retired to a beautiful island villa at Buyukada off Istanbul but were at their more modest rural retreat in the Marmara region when he vanished. He set off after breakfast at 8.30am for his daily 40 minute stroll around a hilly forest trail near Armutlu Koyu with dog Tina and local adopted stray Esmerelda off the leash at his heels. Esmerelda came home safe - but alone - 20 minutes later. Korhan’s disappearance has been compared to the UK case of tragic mum Nicola Bulley , who also vanished while walking with her dog. But Nicola’s dog Willow turned up unharmed on the day she disappeared in January before her drowned body was found three weeks later after being missed by underwater search teams. Three-year-old Doberman bitch Tina has become central to the Turkish hunt because - unlike Nicola’s far less fearsome spaniel - she has vanished alongside her owner. Korhan worked for the US government in Saudi Arabia in the 1980’s then switched to a high-powered role with the Joint Commission On Economic Cooperation in capital Riyadh. He later advised the Saudis how to shape their booming oil economy and work directly for their government for three years before moving back to the US. The regular TV pundit later lectured at Istanbul University while working at Alfa Menkul Investment Bank as Chief Economist until it went bust in 2005. Police probing have looked into his past connections - including his links to the notoriously ruthless Saudi regime behind the butchering of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018. The Berzegs have also revealed that was once offered a ministerial post by former President Turgut Özal in the 90’s - but turned it down. Family lawyer Lawyer M. Emre Akkaş said yesterday: ""While Korhan was working at the World Bank, President Özal offered him to be a minister to manage the economy. “But Korhan did not want this - the current Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Şimşek was Korhan's student.” Korhan’s wife Angela spoke of his professional integrity as she offered the £30,000 reward yesterday. She said: ""It is very difficult to define him - we cannot put him in a mould. “He is so honest that he would leave a place immediately if there is any mistake in his work or environment."" Lawyer Mr Akkaş said searches were continuing but police were no longer commenting on the case after declaring their investigation confidential.

"AN URGENT holiday warning is in place at a popular beach following the fifth drowning death recorded in a week. The idyllic Surin Beach in Phuket, Thailand , has become a graveyard after tourists made the same fatal mistake repeatedly, it was reported. It comes after horrified beachgoers watched a bather fall victim to the sea yesterday. According to Pattaya News, lifeguards performed CPR on the tourist as they tried to revive him. With no avail, he was rushed to a local hospital but was later pronounced dead. Phuket Tourist Police were able to identify the man as 41-year-old Russian national Aleksandr Lunemen. However, authorities have now hit out following the incident and claimed Lunemen ignored the big red safety flags. Local media reported that swimming in the designated area was prohibited and clearly stated to be off-limits due to the hazardous conditions. Ignoring the safety signs ultimately led to his death, authorities claimed. Lunemen's death was the fifth recorded drowning in Phuket within a week - four of which have been tourists.

"HUMAN remains have been found at the house of Vladimir Cheskidov after the Russian ""maniac"" captured and held a woman for 14 years. Ekaterina Belyankina, now 33, escaped and fled Cheskidov’s house this week - and cops have now discovered bones, believed to be those of another woman. The female in question was named Oksana, although her full identity is yet to be disclosed. She was also imprisoned at another property before she was murdered between 2010 and 2011. Cheskidov, 51, was under armed guard in a psychiatric hospital once he was captured but was soon released for his court appearance two days later, having “recovered”. He has now been remanded in custody for two months by a judge pending further investigations into murder, rape and kidnapping. Cheskidov faces life in a grim Russian penal colony if convicted. His mother, 72-year-old Valentina, meanwhile, could face up to 15 years behind bars if also found guilty of kidnapping. As for Ekaterina, she managed to escape after Cheskidov became too drunk to remember to lock her in the dungeon, taking her chance to flee. She was able to relocate her older sister, Elena, who is currently taking care of her. Ekaterina has since revealed that Cheskidov forced her to help him cut up Oksana’s body, whose remains were found in the dungeon, after plunging a knife into her head following an “argument”. According to local reports, she told her sister Elena “that [Vladimir] always had a knife [in his hands], and apparently, [any] step to the left, to the right [led] to punishment “There was another girl there [when she was first held aged 19]. “He introduced [that girl] as his wife. “But then, I don’t know what kind of conflict they had, he plunged a knife right into her head. He said to [Ekaterina]: “If you behave the same way, you will get the same [punishment]. “Then he dismembered her and she [Ekaterina] helped him. “Remains, arms and legs, were packed in a barrel....to bury [them].” Ekaterina - known as Katya - was raped “more than 1,000 times” by Cheskidov and forced to cook for the mother. However, he said in court that his relationship with Ekaterina was one of “love”. His mother claimed: “She joined my son and lived like a queen… “No-one kept her.” She insisted: “Katya lived [with us] at her own free will.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/macabre-human-remains-found-house-836014169.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russian-man-vladimir-cheskidov-51-836014006.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ekaterina-belyankina-now-33-fled-836014182.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russian-man-vladimir-cheskidov-51-836014010-2.jpg",Human bones found at house of ‘maniac’ who imprisoned & tortured sex slave in dungeon for 14 years,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23357508/human-bones-maniac-tortured-sex-slave/
"A MAN was mistakenly overpaid more than 300 times his wages in a major banking blunder and then refused to give it back. The unnamed bloke, from Somogy County in Hungary , received a whopping £80,000 in error for his short stint at the company. He had been working for a firm in the nearby city of Kaposvár, but his employment was terminated while he was still in the trial period. Nevertheless, the employee was set to receive a small pay packet for the shifts he had completed. The bungling business was meant to cough up just 92,549 forints (£205) for his hard work. But because the man had provided an Austrian bank account to wire the funds into, the money had to be paid in the local currency, euros . But in an epic banking fail , the sum was not converted from the Hungarian forints - and they sent him €92,549 (£80,000) instead. Although the former employee may have thought it was his lucky day, his bubble soon burst when the company realised the error. The firm got in touch with their ousted worker and asked him to return the huge amount of cash that had accidentally been sent. But he reportedly claimed he no longer had access to the Austrian bank account, insisting he was unable to acquire any funds. However, his brief taste of wealth soon came to an abrupt end when police got involved in the case. Cops discovered that the man had withdrawn €15,500 (£13,400) in cash from the supposedly impenetrable bank account at an ATM in the south of the country. He then allegedly transferred the finances into another bank account in an attempt to stash some of the money away. Police worked alongside the Kaposvár District Prosecutor’s Office to freeze the bank accounts and recover the money. Reports claim officials have clawed back €72,000 (£62,000) so far and they hope to track down the rest of the funds that were sent mistakenly. The ex-employee has been charged with unlawful appropriation and is set to receive a hefty fine, according to Hvg.hu . He is also expected to have to fork out for compensation to the firm. We previously told how a labourer who was mistakenly overpaid by £44,000 splashed the cash on cocaine and booze binges. And a woman who received an extra £21,000 in her wages from the NHS spent the lot - and wasn't made to pay it back.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/10-20-euro-banknotes-fanned-825458934.jpg,Company accidentally pays employee 300 times his wages in a major bank blunder – and now he’s refusing to give it back,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23357652/company-accidentally-overpaid-employee-refuses-to-return/

Pilots proved they can fulfil their "" Quick Reaction Alerts "" - flights undertaken at a moment's notice - by rushing to intercept them. Footage filmed on a GoPro mounted in the cockpit shows one RAF jet patrolling the skies over the Baltic and ready to defend against any Russian threats. A large aircraft, flanked by two smaller jets, can then be seen entering the frame from the right-hand side. The incredible clip then shows how the observant pilot intercepts the Tupolev Tu-134, known as the ""Flying Kremlin"", thousands of feet above Estonia . RAF personnel used the codeword ""zombie"" during Operation Azotie when referring to a Russian plane acting suspiciously. The Typhoon flyer then swiftly dealt with the two accompanying Ilyushin Il-78 tankers in the tense video. Throughout the four-month mission to protect Nato airspace from Putin's forces, Britain's squadron has intercepted 50 Russian aircraft . They have now returned to the UK with 500 hours of flying under their belt as the Spanish Air Force takes over the role. Around 50 members of the 140 Expeditionary Air Wing returned to Lossiemouth on Thursday. During the most chaotic period of the deployment, pilots scrambled to the skies to intercept Russian planes 21 times in just 21 days. Typhoon pilots from No IX (Bomber) and No 1 (Fighter) squadrons shadowed the aircraft as they flew through international airspace. The deployment also saw the first ever joint air intercept between NATO allies take place between RAF and German pilots. The two nations shadowed a Russian air-to-air refuelling aircraft and transport aircraft flying between St Petersburg and Kaliningrad. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Hundreds of RAF pilots and personnel have spent months away from their families, working round-the-clock alongside our allies to keep Europe’s skies safe. “The UK’s successful leadership of Nato's air policing mission in Estonia, resulting in the interception of dozens of Russian aircraft by the RAF, sends a strong message to Putin that we stand united with our allies against any threat to our borders.” The fighter jet squadron was always held at a moment's notice - ready to scramble and take on any possible threat in the skies. Defence Minister Baroness Goldie DL paid tribute to the ""commitment and dedication"" of the 140 Expeditionary Air Wing in protecting Nato airspace. ""The day-to-day, personal sacrifices made not only by the individuals but also their families in the name of duty are nothing short of commendable,"" she added. While deployed in Estonia, the RAF took place in the largest Nato Air Deployment exercise since the Cold War . In a declared show of force to Putin, the alliance had over 250 aircraft and 10,000 personnel from 25 Nato and partner nations involved in the aerial war games. Last month, The Sun's Jerome Starkey found out what it is like to be intercepted by RAF Typhoons. He was onboard a transport jet as fighters from eight allies blasted into the sky during drills to prepare for a Russian incursion. The jets armed with air-to-air missiles roared up to his plane's wing tips in scenes that echoed the classic film Top Gun. Earlier in July, President Putin’s doomsday jet was intercepted by RAF fighters on a mission over the Baltic Sea. British typhoons closely shadowed the nuclear command and control aircraft as it flew in and out of the Russian city of Kaliningrad - eerily near Nato's borders. In June, the RAF scrambled its fighters to intercept Russian warplanes that were buzzing near to Nato's airspace in a nail-biting mid-air standoff. One thousand British Army troops remain stationed at Tapa Army Base in Estonia.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/moment-raf-fighter-jets-intercept-836059759.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/moment-raf-fighter-jets-intercept-836059760.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/moment-raf-fighter-jets-intercept-836059758.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/56137a97-9c57-4d0e-92b6-edde03734eda.jpg",Heartstopping moment RAF fighter jets intercept Russian ‘zombie’ warplanes menacing Nato border,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23358445/raf-fighter-jets-intercept-russian-zombie-aircraft-over-estonia/
"A MAN whose mother died in a car crash in France has revealed why his last meeting with her will stick with him forever. Izzy Posen was estranged from his family for eight years after leaving the strongly religious Orthodox Jewish community that his parents belonged to in Stamford Hill, North London . In a blog post following his mother Miriam's funeral on Wednesday night, he recounted some of his fondest memories of his dearest ""mummy"". He wrote: ""I wasn’t lucky to have spent lots of time in mummy’s company in recent years. ""Eight years ago I made lifestyle changes that were very difficult for mummy and the whole family. ""Mummy never stopped loving me and caring for me, but based on community advice, I was estranged from family."" According to reports, Izzy had chosen to move away to study physics and philosophy at Bristol University. As the son of a rabbi in an Orthodox community, he would have been expected to avoid secular education and remain within the community. Izzy recalled that the family had spent their first night away together in eight years after his mother fought tirelessly to reunite the family last month. He explained: ""On that unforgettable night away with mummy, we talked a lot. ""Mummy listened to the pain I have been going through. She understood; she ached with me. ""I cuddled into mummy. I asked her, 'Am I too old to cuddle into you?' ""Mummy said, 'You’re never too old for a mother’s cuddles.'"" However, their last meeting came when he was in Stamford Hill for work and the pair met up just before she left for France . He said that Miriam had asked to bring recent photos of him so she could show them to his young siblings as the family was set to reunited in time for the Bar Mitzvah (coming of age ceremony) of one of his brothers. Tragically, she never got the chance to show the children those photos and their first meeting with their older brother was at her funeral this week. Miriam died in a collision near Neuville-Saint-Vaast, France, when another car reportedly swerved in front of the car she was travelling in, accompanied by six family members. The other passengers have now come out of intensive care and are ""recovering well"" according to French authorities. In a touching tribute , Izzy posted a photo of his mother to social media , captioned: ""Goodnight mummy, sleep well."" He concluded his blog post by saying: ""Mummy, we were immensely lucky to have you for as long as you were here. ""You weren’t with us for long, but you gave us enough love and guidance to sustain us for a lifetime. ""We will keep strong and support each other, always keeping in mind your reassuring calmness, because that’s what you would have wanted us to do.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taken-without-permission-mum-killed-836061508.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1fb2e8b9-12aa-4147-bbbe-6cf0a3246e2b.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-thousands-turn-north-london-835538922.jpg",My mum was killed in car crash in France – we were estranged for 8 YEARS but our last meeting came days before she died,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23358928/mum-killed-car-crash-last-meeting-izzy-posen/
"SPANISH summer holiday killjoys have imposed a new crackdown on Brits abroad - now fining tourists for listening to music. Visitors have been warned they face being hit in the pocket to the tune of £700 if caught playing seaside sounds too loudly. The threats come amid a Spanish summertime clampdown also involving four-figure fines for any boozy Brits who hope to sleep off their hangovers on the beach . It's been revealed tourists heading to Spain this summer are at risk if blaring out music too noisily on the beaches of Chipiona in Cadiz. There is the threat of £260 fines for people with sound equipment and musical instruments. The same laws apply to people hurling cigarette butts or else littering the shore with nut shells or litter. And offences deemed most serious can see the penalties rising as high as almost £780, consumer website Health Plan Spain warns. They urge anyone heading to that region to ""pay extra attention"". The Atlantic coastal town of Chipiona sits in Cadiz, an eastern province which boasts the most Blue Flags for high-quality beaches. Its seaside town named Cadiz was acclaimed this year for a beach hiding an attractive secret , one of Europe 's biggest sand dunes. The Sun Online told earlier this week how rules imposed along the coast in one of the Mediterranean 's most popular destinations aim to crack down on drunks, including British tourists . Night-time naps on the shore will be taken seriously by police patrolling the beaches - including in areas such as Valencia , touting fines of up to £1,300. Other potential penalties include £650 for using soap and shampoo when showering on beaches at resorts such as Benidorm , Malaga and Valencia again. Going nude on a Spanish beach where it's not allowed - let alone encouraged as it is at some - could hit you in the pocket for £650. Some towns including Salobreña will make you hand over almost £2,600 if caught with a beachside barbecue - while resorts declared smoke-free include Andalusia , Asturias, the Balearics , the Canary Islands , Catalonia , Galicia and Murcia . Visiting Brits were previously told they face fines in Spain if caught driving topless . Officials in Majorca and Ibiza launched campaigns against booze-fuelled chaos and drunken behaviour - imposing a six-drink-a-day limit instead of having alcohol on tap. A series of Spain's popular destinations have recently introduced tourist taxes to bolster their finances. Popular resorts like Benidorm and the Costa Blanca could be affected - while Barcelona increased its tourist tax price this year and has plans for a further rise next year. Other cities could soon follow suit, with the capital Madrid considering a tourist tax of its own. The latest alerts come as beaches at popular Brit holiday hotspot Gibraltar were closed after an oil spill from a tanker . Beachgoers have also been warned to stay out of the water at a resort due to high pollution , while earlier this week four Spanish beaches were closed due to a ""mystery substance"" .",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock-id-1836465142-836067739.jpg,Spain holiday warning as Brits jetting abroad for summer could be fined £700 for listening to music,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23359542/spain-holiday-warning-brits-abroad-summer-fined-music/
"THE sunbed wars were escalating across Europe earlier today — as The Sun bravely flew into the heart of the action. On the Costa del Sol , we found scores of British tourists who had been caught up in the “carnage” and they described ferocious battles each morning to get poolside loungers. This summer has seen a huge rise in scraps over sunbeds as the ongoing ­heat causes a scramble for the best spots. We’ve reported on incidents across the Mediterranean and now there are even outbreaks near major cities — with Barcelona the latest to be struck. In Greece , we told how locals were trying to ban sunbeds to reclaim their beaches from tourists. But, incredibly, there is still no sign of the Germans in the conflict, although experts expect a counter-offensive from them any day now. When The Sun’s reporter, who has completed her Hostile Environment ­Training, arrived at family favourite Torremolinos yesterday afternoon there were, predictably, no free sun loungers in sight. Many of them were reserved with towels but their owners were nowhere to be seen. Brits wait for up to two hours every morning before the pool opens at the four-star Hotel Estival Torrequebrada to get a lounger. Holidaymakers bring chairs and form a queue outside the gate as they wait patiently for the lifeguard to open the pool area at 9am. Lifeguards have now been forced to open the pool an hour earlier than the scheduled time because of the mammoth queues of eager tourists. But once it is open, “hell breaks loose” with parents telling their kids to run ahead to secure the best beds and adults running to try to beat other UK holidaymakers to a prime location. The resort in the Costa del Sol piles up the loungers overnight, meaning sunseekers have to speedily grab one and claim their place each morning. Minutes after the gates are opened by hotel staff, all the chairs are taken — with those who missed out having to head to the beach or lie on the floor. The nearest public beach charges 14 euros for a sunbed if Brits miss out on the race at their hotel. Jacqueline Jenkins, 55, and her ­husband David, 61, from Newcastle , had planned to go to Rhodes for their ­summer holiday but had to make a last minute change to head to the Costa del Sol when their hotel was closed due to recent wildfires . She told The Sun: “It makes you feel like a little child waiting to get into the school gates. It’s horrible having to wait and queue but that’s what you have to do if you want a bed. It’s rubbish.” They arrived at Hotel Estival Torrequebrada on Tuesday and have been queuing from 8.30am to get a bed. She added: “It’s frustrating when ­people claim a bed with their towels then disappear for the rest of the day. It’s not fair and it’s not right.” Neil Jackson, 51, from Birmingham , told The Sun he was ready to “take his chances” in the morning rush. By mid-afternoon, all beds were still claimed even though the owners of the towels were nowhere to be found. Deborah Pawlikowski, 52, moved from Galway in Ireland to Torremolinos 11 years ago and said she had laughed at the videos of tourists running to get a good spot by the pool. She told The Sun: “I can’t understand why they are doing it. There are so many lovely beaches and always places to sunbathe. That’s no way to spend a holiday in my opinion.” THE race is on for a lounger — at a hotel with up to 1,500 guests but just 100 sunbeds. Gates to the pool area at the Hotel Europa Splash on the Costa Brava near Barcelona open at 9am but queueing starts at dawn. Teachers Paul and Sarah Nesbitt, of Plymouth , said people push each other and try to cut in. Paul, 50, said: “One bloke fell into the pool.” Sarah, 49, added: “It’s carnage. I don’t think the staff who had just washed the floors really believed all the slipping and sliding.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dfrsunbedwarscostadelsol00007JPG-JS836033792.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dfrsunbedwarscostadelsol00002JPG-JS836033687.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dfrsunbedwarscostadelsol00021JPG-JS836034303.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000016341931_Unapprovedjpg-JS836038647.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cmh_vlc_JMSUNBED__12_jpg-JS835897769-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cmh_vlc_JMSUNBED__10_jpg-JS835897767.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cmh_vlc_JMSUNBED__3_jpg-JS835897809.jpg",Sunbed wars escalate across Europe as The Sun bravely flies into heart of ‘carnage’ – even city resorts are being hit,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23359427/sunbed-wars-europe-costa-del-sol-queues/
"TELLY action man Bear Grylls pleaded for calm as 600 youngsters at the World Scout Jamboree fell victim to a heatwave. SAS veteran Bear , 49, the UK’s Chief Scout, called for “resilience” after scores fainted in 40C (104F) heat. But parents blasted the global scouting get-together in South Korea’s North Joella province, where 43,000 wilting youngsters were facing a lack of water at the mosquito-infested location. Britain’s contingent of 4,500 scouts — the largest from any of the 158 nations attending — were being taken to hotels yesterday to escape the heat. The Scout Association said the move was to “alleviate pressure on the site”. The scouts will return home as planned on August 13. Locals, meanwhile, branded the event a “national disgrace” over its lack of shelter or water for the youngsters, despite a £120million budget. Military doctors and nurses were drafted in to treat the ill. The UK Foreign Office said it had officials there giving support. Man vs Wild star Bear , a dad of two, is at the event and was sweating profusely on stage as he told attendees: “All of us in life — in scouting, at jamborees — we need resilience more than ever.” One British mum said: “They’re trying their hardest to make it work but it’s a disaster waiting to happen. We have kids crying, thinking they’re going to die. “Flooding, ambulances everywhere, poor sanitation, not enough food — the list is endless.”",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Untitled-1jpg-JS836031485-1.jpg,Bear Grylls pleads for calm as 600 youngsters at scouts get-together fall victim to heatwave,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23358201/heatwave-world-scout-jamboree-south-korea/
"A DISTRESSED mum burst into tears after she got caught in Benidorm's chaotic sunbed wars. Cayleigh Tuffs, 34, said she did not manage to secure a spot as desperate Brits were ""swarming like ants"" to reserve a space by the pool. The mum splashed out £2,000 for a Jet2 package holiday to Magic Aqua Rock Gardens in the Spanish hotspot with her husband Andrew 37, and eight-year-old daughter Charley. But on their first day, they realise they would have to take part in sunbed wars and start queuing early if they wanted to beat other holidaymakers and secure a spot by the pool. Cayleigh from Chesterfield, Derbyshire , told the Sun Online: ""They're like ants scurrying for food. It's horrendous. ""We've seen people throw towels across the pool to get beds and people are running even though it's massively slippery. ""We go on holiday five times a year and this is the first time we've ever seen anything like this. ""On the first day, we got here in the afternoon so there was no chance of getting a bed so we sat under a slide to get some shade. ""I was nearly in tears, it was horrendous. ""I've never wanted to cry on holiday before, but I did on that first day. The mum who works as an IT manager noticed the pool is packed with queuing Brits an hour before it opens at 10am then ""chaos"" ensues when the gates are opened by staff. Footage shot by Cayleigh on Thursday shows holidaymakers crammed near multiple entrances before rushing across the slippery floor to throw their towels on shaded sunbeds. Stunned Cayleigh can be heard saying ""Jesus Christ"" as she and Charley wait to see if Andrew, who began queuing at 9am, could bag a spot for them. The mum says there are at least three different entrances to the pool and some have even resorted to using a ""sneaky"" entrance near the toilet blocks. She added: ""Staff have no control. There's a sign that says 'if you leave towels for 20 minutes, we'll remove them' but I haven't seen that happen in five days. ""There are people saving beds for five or six hours when nobody's been on them. That's really frustrating when I just want to watch my daughter play. ""When we're not sitting around the pool we can't see her play so she's either got to stay with us or we've got to be in the pool with her. We can't leave her on her own. ""Everyone's moaning about the situation but I just avoid the conflict."" Cayleigh, who flew home on Friday after five nights away, says she usually goes to ""more relaxed"" resorts in countries such as Tunisia or Turkey- and vowed never to return to Benidorm. She said: ""People I've shown have been shocked about it and they think it's hilarious. You've just got to laugh about it. ""I've never seen so many people packed into one area in my life. ""I'll never come with my family again because of how chaotic it is. I've been with my friends before but it's been nothing like this year."" Jet2 and Magic Costa Blanca, who oversee Magic Aqua Rock Garden, have been contacted for comment. It comes after holidaymakers have even taken to reserving spots on the ground at some resorts. Staff at a hotel in Tenerife were caught removing them after cheeky tourists had dumped their belongings and left.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-jet2-package-holiday-magic-836030168.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-jet2-package-holiday-magic-836030173.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-jet2-package-holiday-magic-836030106.jpg",I was left in tears by Benidorm’s brutal sunbed wars – Brits swarm like ants looking for food battling over best spots,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23351529/left-tears-benidorms-brutal-sunbed-wars-brits-ants-spots/
"TUCKED away deep in the New Mexico desert, a team of scientists developed the world's most devastating weapon away from prying eyes. Led by the notorious J Robert Oppenheimer , the first-ever nuclear bomb was created at Los Alamos - able to wipe out the entire globe. Los Alamos - a self-contained town, with wives, children and a church - was the home of the top-secret Project Y, part of the wider hush-hush Manhattan Project. There, fearing Germany was two years ahead in the nuclear arms race , experts worked relentlessly to build a plutonium-based atomic bomb. And in just 27 months, the US accomplished the unthinkable and detonated the first-ever nuke weapons in a test code-named Trinity. Fast forward almost six decades, eerie reminders of the atomic bomb's birth remain. Los Alamos is still an active lab - but the sites used by the Manhattan Project are strictly off-limits to the public. Most of the original infrastructure was torn down after the war, having been constructed hastily and at pace. One of the most key buildings still remains - V-Site - where the first nuclear explosive device was assembled ahead of the Trinity test. The explosion will forever be noted in history books as the first-ever detonation of a nuclear weapon and has been now recreated in star-studded movie Oppenheimer by British director Christopher Nolan . Sitting in a bunker 20 miles away from the test site in the New Mexico desert on July 16 1945, Oppenheimer - depicted by Cillian Murphy in the blockbuster movie - watched on with bated breath as the countdown ticked away. The best case scenario would see the 25-kiloton blast send a mushroom cloud seven miles into the sky, as calculated by his team of experts. The worst result would set off a chain reaction that would destroy the whole planet. But the explosion was deemed a success and a bomb named Little Boy was used on the city of Hiroshima just three weeks later - killing hundreds of thousands. Despite the significance of the work being done, the highly explosive sphere for the Trinity bomb was assembled in the humble wooden and asbestos-shingled buildings at V-Site. Scientists worked around the clock on the weapon - also known as Gadget - surrounded by tall pines, with access heavily restricted before the bomb was eventually ferried to the test site. Another part of the site that remains is Gun Site, which acted as a safe haven for the experts to watch the tests using a periscope. Two types of atomic bombs were ultimately developed The chilling Little Boy bomb was a gun-type design that fired a mass of uranium at another to spark a chain reaction. Scientists used the Gun Site bunker to plan ballistic tests before watching them using a built-in periscope tower remotely from under the ground. The second type of bomb developed was a complex implosion-type design centred around plutonium. Assembly work for this type of bomb - nicknamed Fat Man - started at V-Site in 1944. The following year, it was dropped on Nagasaki three days after Little Boy caused huge destruction in Hiroshima. The US military argued that the operation saved lives by shortening the war. But away from the assembly sites sits Pond Cabin, a modest-looking ranch building that had a much darker use. Situated in the canyon miles away from the main research centre, physicist Emilio Segrè adopted the cabin as his office - making it the place for groundbreaking plutonium research and radiation testing. Segrè, who died in 1989 aged 84, previously said: ""At this time I acquired a small laboratory for measuring spontaneous fission, the like of which I have never seen before or since. ""It was a log cabin that had been occupied by a ranger and it was located in a secluded valley a few miles from Los Alamos. ""It could be reached only by a jeep trail that passed through fields of purple and yellow asters and a canyon whose walls were marked with Indian carvings."" One of the final parts of the site that remains to this day is the Slotin Building. The unassuming white building complete with blue doors was named after Canadian physicist Louis Slotin. He conducted dangerous criticality testing with uranium and later plutonium cores - earning himself the nickname of Chief Armorer of the United States. Slotin would fearlessly experiment with the possibility of nuclear chain reactions - known as ""tickling the dragon's tail"" after physicist Richard Feynman compared the tests to ""tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon"". The building was named after Slotin after he was exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and died just days later. He was slowly bringing together two halves of a berrylium-coated sphere around a plutonium core when the screwdriver separating them slipped. The room filled with a bright blue light and Slotin rushed to use his own body to shield his colleagues. He was rushed to hospital but died days later after slipping into a coma. Los Alamos was shrouded in secrecy for years and resulted in the creation of a terrifying nuke weapon able to doom the whole world. Oppenheimer was driven by a desire to make sure Adolf Hitler did not get hold of nuclear weapons first. But real dilemma came when Hitler took his own life in April 1945, which was followed by Germany’s surrender a month later. Some of Oppenheimer’s team felt there was no longer a need to develop a weapon of mass destruction, however the new US President, Harry S Truman, disagreed. He wanted to use the atomic bomb on Japan, which was still at war with the Allies in the Pacific. Having initially celebrated the success of his creation, Oppenheimer started to feel guilty about the horrific impact of these weapons on innocent civilians. Survivors reported seeing charred bodies, ripped flesh and skin imprinted with the stripes from clothing. When Oppenheimer - who died aged 62 in 1967 - met with Truman in the White House , he said: “Mr President, I feel I have blood on my hands.” That angered Truman who later described him as a “cry-baby scientist”.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625934.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625932.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625926.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625930.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/benny-safdie-edward-teller-cillian-832286925.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625928.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625936.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/now-i-death-destroyer-worlds-821525200-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/g155fn-atomic-explosion-detonation-worlds-832741740-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625918.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625922-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-eerie-abandoned-los-alamos-835625935-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/m2hy2m-trinity-test-site-manhattan-832741752-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chief-manhattan-engineering-district-first-832739480.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jfpkwd-ground-zero-showing-melted-832741695-1.jpg",Inside eerie abandoned Oppenheimer lab at Los Almos where 1st nuke was built & scientists feared they’d destroyed world,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23298619/los-alamos-lab-oppenheimer-nuclear-weapon/
"KOBE Bryant proudly proclaimed himself a ""girl dad"" and slammed any suggestion that he needed a boy to carry on the NBA legacy. His four daughters were the apple of the legendary basketball player 's eye - here's more on his children . The five-time NBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist had four children with wife Vanessa , 41, a former model and music video star from Los Angeles. Vanessa met Kobe on the set of a music video when she was 17 and still in high school. The couple were parents to four daughters: Natalia ""Nani"" Diamante Bryant was born on January 19, 2003. The volleyball player is the eldest of Kobe's daughters. Vanessa revealed that Kobe wanted Natalia to one day take over his company and said the NBA icon would binge movies with her. She said: ""He shared a love of movies and breakdown of films with Natalia. ""He enjoyed renting out theaters and taking Natalia to watch the newest Star Wars movie or Harry Potter films. ""They would have movie marathons and he enjoyed every second of it. ""He loved the typical tearjerkers, too, and he loved watching Stepmom, Steel Magnolias, and Little Women. He had a tender heart."" Gianna ""Gigi"" Maria Onore Bryant was born on May 1, 2006. She had a very close relationship with Kobe, who would call her the female version of him. She adopted the nickname Mambacita like her dad's alter-ego the Black Mamba.

"UKRAINE has unleashed a second marine drone attack in just 24 hours on Putin's Black Sea fleet, blasting a hole through yet another of his ships. Dramatic footage onboard the explosive-packed kamikaze sea drone shows the exact moment it struck the 4,754-ton Russian tanker in the Black Sea off the coast of annexed Crimea. The engine room of the 463ft-long oil and chemical tanker was flooded and the vessel was forced to seek help, according to the audio of those onboard. Members of the 11-strong crew suffered abrasions from shattered glass as the control room was partially destroyed. Bright explosions could be seen from afar as the tanker - loaded with fuel - was hit. In a humiliating blow to Putin , the attack came only a day after Russian warship Olenegorsky Gornyak was damaged following an almost identical Ukrainian sea drone attack. According to sources from Ukraine's security service (SBU), Saturday's daring mission was again orchestrated jointly with the Ukrainian navy and 450kg of TNT explosives were involved, BBC reported. A giant explosion seen from the shore was initially thought to have been an attack on Putin’s beloved £3 billion Crimean Bridge which also faced overnight drone assaults. But it emerged that the huge night strike was on the SIG oil and chemical tanker which regularly carries cargoes - allegedly including explosives - between Russia and Syria. The voice of a SIG crew member seeking help by radio was overheard saying: “We cannot move by ourselves without a tug. The engine room is completely flooded. The management don't know what will be decided….”. Tugs went to assist the vessel and the crew were given pumps, while an assessment is being made of damage to the vessel. Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Medvedev, warned Ukraine that there would be retaliation for their ""terrorist attacks"" and accused them of trying to ""arrange an ecological catastrophe in the Black Sea"". The Russian-flagged SIG, built in St Petersburg, has been under sanctions since 2019 due to its role in supplying cargoes to Syria. The Ukrainian defence ministry warned on July 21 that ships heading to Russian ports would be considered part of Putin’s war effort and were potential military targets. Only a day earlier Russia had threatened Ukraine with a similar warning. Earlier this week Russia reported that the Vasily Bykov and Sergey Kotov patrol ships had been targeted by Ukrainian kamikaze drones. At the time the two vessels were escorting the Sig en-route from Syria, it is believed. “Such an attack is intended not only to force Russia to return to the infamous grain deal, but also to partially jeopardise the logistical capabilities of the Russian Armed Forces in the Middle East,” stated Rybar pro-war channel in Russia. The badly-holed Olenegorsky Gornyak landing ship is now in dock in Novorossiysk naval base. Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky , said the use of drones in the Black Sea, ""will ensure freedom and security in the Black Sea for world trade”. He claimed  “drones are changing the rules of the game and returning the water area to full-fledged external jurisdiction”, “The presence of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea will be put to an end, and with it, the traditional Moscow blackmail,” he said. The attack follows a series of suspected Ukrainian strikes on Russia from the air and sea recently as Kyiv vowed to bring the war close to Putin's doorstep. In the so-called "" War of the Drones "", Ukraine has been fighting back with increased vigour and equipment, launching 120 suspected strikes deep into Russia in only six months. Meanwhile, a major Russian missile plant has been hit by an explosion threatening production of lethal Iskander missiles used against Ukraine. Initial reports pointed to a drone strike on a “secret” workshop at Votkinsky Machine-Building Plant in Udmurtia region - a major weapons making enterprise  - but later claims said the explosion was triggered during tests. The company downplayed the incident and stated the damage was minimal, no employees were injured and ""there is no threat to life or injury."" However, doubt online has been cast over the official statement as users have suggested the damage is more extensive than admitted. Moscow has consistently adopted a brazen policy of attempting to hide incidents that would harm its war effort.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/attack-uncrewed-maritime-drones-russian-836148309.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/attack-uncrewed-maritime-drones-russian-836148311.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/attack-uncrewed-maritime-drones-russian-836148318.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/attack-uncrewed-maritime-drones-russian-836148314.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/attack-uncrewed-maritime-drones-russian-836148317.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/o-bottom-incredible-pov-moment-835991927.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/novorossiysk-naval-base-attacked-two-835954523-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/81e003c8-8c63-40c9-aae2-1ffdf92d6120.jpg",Moment Ukrainian sea drone hits SECOND Russian warship in 24 hours in latest blast to rock Putin’s Black Sea fleet,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23361102/ukrainian-drone-russian-warship-blast/
"OUSTED Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has been handed a three-year jail sentence over corruption allegations. An Islamabad court found him guilty of illegally selling state gifts - a charge the politician denies. Khan's team says he will appeal the conviction. A judge has ordered his immediate arrest and police arrested Khan in the eastern city of Lahore today, his lawyer said. It's a fresh blow to Khan's bid to return to power. Legal experts say a conviction in the case could end Khan's chances of participating in the national elections to be held in early November. The cricketer-turned-politician was accused of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession that were received during foreign visits and worth more than £400,000. The gifts allegedly included luxury watches given by a royal family, according to government officials, who have alleged previously that Khan's aides sold them in Dubai. Khan denies any wrongdoing. A crowd outside the courtroom began chanting ""Imran Khan is a thief"" after they heard the ruling. Since the former Prime Minister's removal from power in April last year after a no-confidence vote, he has been slapped with over 150 legal cases. The 70-year-old faces a plethora of allegations related to corruption, terrorism, contempt of courts and inciting people to violence over deadly protests in May. He has claimed his ousting was illegal, the result of Western conspiracy and has heavily campaigned against the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif. In May, Khan had been arrested in connection with another corruption case. The ex-cricket star was arrested by agents from Pakistan 's anti-corruption body, and dragged out of his wheelchair by a huge crowd of cops in riot gear. After the politician was whisked away, a scuffle broke out between the former premier's supporters and police. His lawyer was left injured, as were several cops and members of the public. His furious followers then attacked government and military property across the country. Khan again denied wrongdoing and was released on bail within days. In November of last year, Khan accused the incumbent Prime Minister Sharif of orchestrating a plot to assassinate him after he was shot at a rally. Khan, 70, was delivering a speech from his campaign truck in Wazirabad, in the east of the country, when a gunman opened fire. Shocking footage shows the moment a hail of gunfire ripped through the former premier 's convoy - hitting him in the shin.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pakistans-prime-minister-imran-khan-754937694.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/addresses-supporters-anti-government-march-772212333.jpg",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan handed three-year jail sentence over corruption charges,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23361314/pakistan-imran-khan-jail-corruption/
"WHEN Ukraine launched its much-anticipated counter-attack in June, many hoped it would quickly smash through Russian lines and end the war by Christmas. That hasn’t happened and instead, Kyiv has found itself fighting on five fronts, according to analysis by retired Australian general Mick Ryan, of the CSIS think-tank. Troops are grinding out assaults in the south and east, drones are battling it out by air and by sea, and diplomats are soliciting overseas aid to keep the gears of war turning. Failure on any of these fronts could prove fatal to Zelensky’s ambition to liberate his whole country, so Kyiv must now execute a careful balancing act - ensuring gains in one place don’t lead to losses in another. Here, experts break down how Ukraine is progressing on each front, what its commanders need to do to next ensure victory, and how the war might play out into 2024 - and beyond. Ukraine’s long-awaited counter-offensive suddenly roared into life on June 4 as a two-pronged assault was launched in the south. But almost as quickly as it started the attack seemed to stop, with Russian propagandists flaunting images of wrecked German Leopard tanks and US Bradley fighting vehicles. Analysts Michael Kofman, Franz Stefan-Gady and Rob Lee, who recently returned from the frontlines, believe this was a genuine attempt by Ukraine to make a rapid breakthrough that backfired and ended with heavy losses. That forced a re-think: The Ukrainians are now attempting to grind down the Russian defences while holding Western gear back to deliver a hammer-blow once the line is weak. Steph Twitty, a retired US general now with the CEPA think-tank, told The Sun: ""They are making incremental progress, which is better than no progress. ""What you're seeing are tactical victories, but as long as they can whittle away then they can turn into strategic victories such as breaking the main defensive lines. ""A lot of people are critical but I’m not. There are multiple minefields, trenches, wire fences, reconnaissance forces, and the main defensive belt to get through. ""You want to do this slowly because lives are at stake."" That strategy is now paying off. In recent days Ukraine has recaptured the town of Staromaiors'ke, in the southeast, and is threatening Robotnye, in the southwest. The goal remains a breakthrough of Russian lines, which General Ryan says is still possible. ""It won’t be the sudden rush that people had hoped for in the early days and weeks,"" he said. ""You can break through fast or slow but at the end of the day it is still a breakthrough. ""And you only have to break through in one place. Then you need to hold the break open, and bring in forces to exploit it. ""Put simply: Ukraine needs to kill Russians and take territory,"" General Ryan says. Wagner spent the long winter months capturing Bakhmut, but almost as soon as they took it Ukraine began taking it back. Unlike in the south, where Russia had months to dig trenches and lay mines, defences in the east are light and that has meant Ukrainian troops are advancing much faster. Flanking moves to the north and south have put the city in danger of being surrounded, with General Ryan saying the Russians will be ""forced to make some difficult decisions soon."" In an attempt to alleviate pressure on Bakhmut, Russia has gathered around 100,000 troops further to the north and is attacking Ukrainian lines near Kreminna and Svatove. But, observers from the ISW think-tank noted: ‘This Russian effort has likely been somewhat muted by the diversion of elite troops from southern Luhansk to Bakhmut... ""Russian gains in Luhansk have been generally less significant than Ukrainian gains around Bakhmut… It is far from clear, therefore, if the Russians will benefit as much from their diversionary efforts."" And this is almost certainly what the Ukrainians wanted, according to General Twitty, who characterised the Bakhmut attack as a ""supporting effort"". He added: ""[The Ukrainians] have two axes in which they’re applying pressure. ""The two-pronged attack in the south, which is the main effort, and the supporting effort in Bakhmut. ""You want to put pressure in multiple places so if one falls Russians will have to move forces to support that area. You want to keep them guessing."" Moving forward, General Ryan said the focus in the east should be to draw in and wear down as many Russian units as possible to stop them being deployed elsewhere. ""What they do now should be making sure Russians aren’t capable of mounting a winter offensive after this battle is over"", he said. Russia has now expanded its deadly drone and missile barrage of Ukraine’s cities to include its ports and grain warehouses on the Black Sea and Danube River. The move aims to wipe billions off the Ukrainian economy by blocking exports, whilst forcing Kyiv to make an impossible choice between protecting its civilians or its grain. That’s because, even though Ukraine’s allies have supplied air defences, the country is simply too big to protect in its entirety, General Ryan says. But Kyiv has begun hitting back, striking Moscow several times with long-range drones including two hits on the same tower block which houses a number of important ministries. That has pressured Putin and prompted a crackdown on dissent, with high-profile war blogger Igor Girkin - who has been highly critical of the war effort - now under arrest. General Twitty adds: ""What the Ukrainians are doing with drones, they’re thinking strategically about this fight. They are posing the Russians with multiple dilemmas. ‘""Now they have to think about protecting their capital, protecting the homeland, as well as defeating the attack to break the land bridge [between the Donbas and Crimea] and an attack in Bakhmut. ""The war hasn’t hit Russia properly, it hasn’t disrupted life of Russian people, but now you’re starting to see that more. ""I would expect Ukrainians to ratchet this up and try to break the will of the Russian people."" Ukraine has no functioning navy, and yet it has still managed to mount naval operations. The latest developments have seen seaborne drones like the Magura V5 used to attack Russian warships, the port of Sevastopol, and the Kerch Bridge. On August 4, a Russian transport ship was blown up in the port of Novorossiysk by a drone believed to be a Magura, while they were also used unsuccessfully to attack intelligence ships Ivan Khurs and Priazovye. A second sea drone attack also damaged a tanker just 24 hours later leaving it completely stranded. Sevastopol, Russia’s main naval base in the Black Sea, has also been targeted several times by drones that were shot and sunk. But an audacious attack against the Kerch Bridge - which links Crimea to mainland Russia - was successful and took down part of the road bridge last month. The road is less important than the rail section for disrupting military transports, but the attack nonetheless serves as an important propaganda win for Kyiv. Now, Russian warships are attempting to blockade Ukraine’s ports to stop grain supplies from flowing which Kyiv is bound to try and target. ""Those drones will be seeking to make it difficult for Russia to have freedom of movement in the Black Sea,’ General Ryan adds. ""Ukraine has no navy to speak of so there will be no big naval engagement, but they will try to limit Russia’s ability to operate."" Though it lacks the attention-grabbing drama of the counter-attack, General Ryan believes success in the strategic campaign is where Ukraine’s true route to victory lies. Kyiv has to keep its Western allies motivated for the long fight, he says, because the war will almost certainly last into 2024 - and maybe beyond that. That means supplies of vital ammunition, air defence missiles, armour and cash will have to keep flowing whatever else is going on in the world. Ukraine is also desperate for deliveries of F-16 fighter jets - which its pilots are due to train on soon - and long-range ATACAMS missiles. But important elections in Taiwan, which could rile up China, and America, which could return Donald Trump to power, are likely to prove a distraction next year. ‘‘Maintaining Western strategic patience is key,"" General Ryan says. ""I’d say there’s a 50/50 chance this war could continue into 2025. And the reason it could go on is because of the Russians. ""Ultimately it is they who will decide when the war ends, because they will hopefully be the ones who are defeated and decide to withdraw. ""Putin still thinks that a long war is the winning strategy for Russia. Most of his assumptions about the war have been wrong and I hope he’s wrong about that too. ""We [kept patient] in Afghanistan for 20 years and we should do the same in Ukraine. The country is much more important to Western security than Afghanistan ever was.’ General Twitty agreed: ‘The thing I would reinforce is: This will be a long, protracted war, and it will take a while for Ukrainians to accomplish the mission of breaking Russian defences. ""There is a lot more fighting that has to take place here before the Ukrainians are successful. Time is what folks need to understand."" But, asked whether Ukraine can be successful, he added simply: ""I do.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SC_GRAPHIC_UKRAINE-MAP.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MEGA916536_November_9_2022_My_016_Ukrainian-military-training-in-Mykolaiv-region-Ukraine-09-Nov-2-.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ukrainian-drone-targets-russian-amphibious-835997324.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GETTY_Ukrainian-soldiers-deployed-in-Bakhmut_NEW_GYI1551190342jpg-JS833894962.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky-share-831210316.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2022-battlefields-ukraine-fog-war-836107173.jpg","Ukraine is fighting brutal five-front war against Putin – here’s what happens next & it’s bad for Vlad, says top general",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23361586/ukraine-five-front-war-putin-happens-next-general/
"FOOTAGE shows the moment helpless tourists watched on in horror as the publishing boss of Harry Potter died in a boat collision off Italy's Amalfi coast. Adrienne Vaughan, 45, President of Bloomsbury USA , was fatally struck by a propeller after being thrown from a speedboat carrying her family. Adrienne, 45, her husband Mike and children, Leanna, 14, and Mason, 11, had chartered a boat to tour some of Italy 's southern coast on Thursday. At around 6.30pm, their seven metre pleasure boat collided with a 45 metre Tortuga ship filled with 85 people celebrating a wedding. The shocking video shows the cheerful sun-soaked celebrations for the bride and groom following their boat ceremony. Suddenly, the boat rocks and screams can be heard. The wedding guests stop dancing and put down their drinks to rush to the side of the boat. ""What happened?"" someone asks as people yell and run past the wedding altar in the background. ""A ship collided with us,"" a shaken man shouts back. The footage then reveals the horrified looks of the holidaymakers as they witness the immediate aftermath of the fatal incident. Later scenes show the hull of the New York family's broken pleasure boat jammed next to the far larger tourist boat. Helicopters and ambulances immediately responded but Adrienne was declared dead. Her husband was also thrown from the boat and reportedly suffered serious limb injuries, including a dislocated shoulder and lacerated wounds. The children are said to be uninjured but suffering from shock. Their boat's skipper, 30, suffered from fractured ribs and was taken to hospital. Witness Pietro Luzzolino, who was working as a barman at the wedding, alleged that the skipper appeared ""drunk"". He told Italian newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno : ""The driver was vomiting, we got the impression that he was drunk. The investigators will ascertain it."" Following the tragic collision, sources claim that the skipper tested positive in a toxicology test, according to Italian outlets Ansa and Italy24 . The investigation is ongoing and both boats involved in the collision have been seized by police. The mayor of Massa Lubrense, Lorenzo Balducelli, said the ""whole community is shocked"". ""The misfortune that occurred in the waters of the Amalfi Coast affects us all and leaves us dismayed."" In reference to the skipper at the helm of their boat, he stated that he doesn't ""know him personally"" and will leave it up the judiciary to establish his responsibility in the crash. ""Instead, I want to express all my closeness and that of the city to the victim's husband and two children, Adrienne Vaughan, an American tourist who had chosen our area for this holiday period together with his family"". Adrienne was made US president of Bloomsbury publishing house in 2021. She had previously been involved with famous projects including the Harry Potter series. A former colleague described her as a ""charismatic true chief"". They wrote on LinkedIn : ""She was my coach and my mentor. I cherished working along with her on daily basis. It was at all times prepared to assist others."" Only two days before the tragedy, the family had visited Rome and taken pictures in front of iconic landmarks, including the Trevi Fountain and the Colosseum.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4a3e80ec-3c25-48a1-a0ff-17359c7fbee0.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/boat6-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/boat4-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/boat1-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/boat2-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/peedboat-tragedy-harry-potter-publisher-836002303-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-adrienne-vaughan-poses-portrait-836066026.jpg",Helpless tourists watch in horror as Harry Potter publisher boss Adrienne Vaughan is killed by speedboat propeller,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23361809/tourists-watch-adrienne-vaughan-speedboat/
"FORGET singing for your supper - this restaurant asks you to fish for yours. Described as one of ""craziest things to do in Japan"", customers sit in a large wooden boat and catch their food fresh from the waters around it - but it isn't for everyone. Zauo Fishing Restaurant in Osaka, Japan , invites their guests to grab a rod and get stuck in. A TikTok , posted by the popular food and travel vlogger Tina Pik , shows off the bizarre set up inside the large restaurant flooded with water. She tells her fans: ""[This is] one of the craziest things to do in Japan."" ""The inside is absolutely bonkers,"" she adds before explaining how you can choose whether to fish off the boat, through a window of a booth or from the sidelines. ""Patience is key my friends, and once you make a catch - your victory will be heard across the entire restaurant."" A loud drum plays and other diners cheer to ""celebrate your catch"". After a ""proud photo"" with your catch, she says, the chefs then prepare a meal for you. The TikToker looks amazed as she sits down to tuck into a large plate of sashimi as well as fried and steamed fish. ""However you like it,"" she tells her followers. However, not everyone shared in her enthusiasm. The video, which has been liked almost two million times, was littered with hundreds of negative comments by those who felt uneasy at the concept. ""Imagine a place like this but instead of fish its cows,"" said one. Another chimed in: ""That just seems cruel."" ""The fish either starve or get eaten,"" wrote a third. ""I couldn't do that,"" a fourth said. Meanwhile, others couldn't wait to join in on the meal prep. ""Why does Japan have the coolest stuff,"" replied one. A second user said: ""Guys, she's not lying. You absolutely have to try this. It was definitely one of my favourite memories from Osaka."" A fellow food creator, Billy Biehl , also ventured into the famed restaurant and took his fans a long for the ride. He documented his entire experience, particularly the moment he manages to catch a huge fish. It's then quickly whisked away to the chefs who return it beautifully fried and Billy tucks in, saying ""the fish was amazing."" The restaurant also boasts lobsters, prawns and clams which can all be fished out of the tanks. The prices at Zauo depend on the catch and if you fishing skills aren't up to scratch, the staff can step in and help. You can dine at the restaurant without catching a fish, but you get a discount for reeling it in yourself. Trying to emulate its success in Japan, Zaou went international and opened a restaurant in New York in 2018. But after a lack of customers paired with an outcry over the concept itself, the restaurant closed after only two years.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/39f77dbc-3551-4282-a8c8-1a78fefe6132.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/everyone-thinks-good-idea-https-836194382.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/food.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/everyone-thinks-good-idea-https-836194440.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/everyone-thinks-good-idea-https-836195475.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/e9c705e5-521f-40ba-abd3-c042dd2bfe82.jpg",Inside seafood restaurant where customers catch their OWN fish – but not everyone thinks it’s a good idea,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23362474/inside-restaurant-catch-own-fish-japan/
"TAMIL actor Mohan, best known for his role in Apoorva Sagodharagal, has died aged 60. The fallen star was reportedly struggling for work in the years leading up to his death and had resorted to begging on the streets of the south Indian city of Madurai. He was spotted lying dead on the side of the road on July 31 near to Thiruparkundram temple. Local cops reported there was no foul play involved with the 60-year-old's death, but his body has been sent for an autopsy. The tragic actor reportedly lost his wife 10 years ago and his economic situation only worsened since then. Despite being one of five siblings, his family allegedly did not offer to help him when he fell on hard times, The Indian Express reported. Born in the Selem region, Mohan moved away from home to pursue acting. He managed to be cast in plenty of Tollywood films but largely in uncredited roles. His big break came in 1989, when he was cast as the best friend of superstar Kamal Haasan in the hit film Apoorva Sagodharagal. He later played the role of a beggar in Arya’s critically-acclaimed film Naan Kadavul, directed by Bala.

"BRUTAL Mexican drug cartels are pimping ordinary pick-ups and transforming them into Mad Max-style ‘Franken-tanks’. Underground workshops are churning out hundreds of the post-apocalyptic looking battle wagons as the narcos ' ultra violence ratchets up. Drug lords equip the monster trucks with battering rams, four-inch-thick steel plates and turrets for machine guns to take on law enforcement and rival mobs. Known by Mexican law enforcement as narco-tanks, rhino trucks or simply monstruos - meaning monster - they are often painted in camouflage patterns and emblazoned with the cartel’s initials. The trucks are the latest additions to the cartels' high tech arsenals unleashing bloody mayhem on the cocaine trail. South American narcos have even produced submarines capable of crossing the Atlantic . Security analyst Romain Le Cour told the New York Times of the narco-tanks: “The monsters are the way to send the message, ‘I’m in charge, and I want everyone to see I’m in charge’.” The senior expert at the Switzerland-based Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime added: “These are commando-style groups looking to replicate special forces in how they’re armed, how they’re trained, how they look.” The cartels like to show off their homemade tanks on TikTok and other social media with rap or folk songs bragging about the gang’s bloodthirsty exploits. The narco-tanks - pioneered by the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas syndicate - first emerged around a decade ago. Since then they have become increasingly more sophisticated in both design and weaponry. Some of the monsters have cockpit-like command seats in the front of the vehicle complete with an array of flashing dashboard lights. The trucks' armour has portholes where machine guns can be poked out from the interior to fire at enemies. Many also have a hatch similar to a tank. Security expert Héctor Romero Sánchez revealed that cartels kidnapped mechanics and forced them to work on modifying the monsters at clandestine workshops. He told Foro TV: ""Once the kidnapping is committed, they take them to their workshops. Those workshops can be in different parts of the Mexican Republic. ""If the technicians are lucky they are set free and leave. Unfortunately, when they’re not so lucky they are killed."" Pick-ups to be converted - with Chevrolet Silverados and Ford F-150s the most popular- are often stolen in the US and brought south of the border. Mexico City ballistics expert Jorge Septién said the rise of the monster trucks was proof the cartels go to any length to “enforce by violent means their dominance against adversary gangs and against authority.’’ Mr Septién told the New York Times: ''It has to do with a status symbol. The first ones we saw were practically blow-torched and welded in a very shoddy way.” However, the armaments expert says that newer models now ''look like a military vehicle” from a distance. In June Mexican armed forces destroyed 14 of the home-made armoured vehicles that were seized in the northeastern border state of Tamaulipas. In photos released by Mexico’s attorney general's office the camouflaged monsters had battering rams and reinforced armour capable of protecting against explosions and bullets. The Tamaulipas Attorney General’s Office said: “The modifications applied to these vehicles represent a danger to the safety of law enforcement agencies and the community in general. “Their destruction diminishes the mobility and firepower of these organised criminal groups.” In the last four years Tamaulipas state police have seized 257 similar Franken-tanks from narcos. The sheer number of monster trucks seized by the authorities demonstrates the financial muscle of the cartels. It also shows the importance placed on the vehicles in fighting rival drug syndicates. It's perhaps why the mobsters are keen to show off their homemade weaponry. In 2020 the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (JNGC) released a chilling video showing their paramilitary-style foot soldiers in front of a snaking queue of camouflaged armoured cars. It was a blatant and provocative show of force to intimidate rivals and the government’s security personnel. In December JNGC gangster Antonio Oseguera Cervantes - nicknamed Tony Montana, the lead character in narco hit movie Scarface - was arrested. Montana was allegedly in charge of logistics - including monster truck production - for the cartel. His younger brother Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes - known as El Mencho - founded CJNG around 2012. It soon became one of the most feared criminal organisations on Earth. Other weapons at the disposal of the narco private armies include rocket launchers and rocket-propelled grenades capable of shooting down military helicopters and steel-penetrating Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifles. Last month four security officials and two civilians were killed with a roadside anti-vehicle mine in Jalisco, western Mexico. State governor Enrique Alfaro described it as an ""act of terror"" which “shows what these organised crime groups are capable of"". Despite their sinister appearance, the monster trucks can have their drawbacks when it comes to actual fighting. Laden with heavy steel plates, they can be slow and unwieldy, especially in narrow, urban roads. Poor workmanship can also see them malfunctioning. Security analyst Alexei Chévez, based in Cuernavaca, Mexico, said: “We see them constantly breaking down and being abandoned.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photograph-provided-mexico-s-attorney-835845460.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/f55df1ba-7c9f-4f60-80a7-0d96e42d1376.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/picture-shows-members-jalisco-nueva-639644650.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2010-photo-destroyed-armored-truck-835654882.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mexican-policemen-stand-guard-next-835756279.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fiery-battle-rival-cartels-sees-836016027.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/720575d0-aefd-48f4-958c-906c6923a495.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/32f27790-0fe4-48aa-9762-da71456cbb36.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/9c85d445-29cd-4acb-a6b6-539666e48391.jpg",How world’s bloodiest cartels are pimping up Mad Max-style monster trucks with machine gun turrets to rule cocaine trail,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23327271/cartels-mexico-drugs-tanks-narcos-jalisco-mad-max/
"SHOCKING CCTV footage captured the moment an elderly postman was attacked in a petrol station after he was wrongfully accused of being a paedophile. Aussie veteran John Burke's death in hospital three months later was a direct result of this attack, his lawyers allege. This week, a Supreme Court trial began in Victoria, Australia over the death of the 74-year-old. Troy Maskell, 44, pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter of Burke, whose condition reportedly deteriorated in his 11-week hospital stint following the attack. Maskell's lawyers stated that there is no doubt he injured Burke, but argued he was not responsible for the victim's death. Defence barrister Julia Munster said: ""His actions, while shameful, stupid, unlawful and whatever else you might want to call them, did not cause Mr Burke’s death."" However, Crown Prosecutor Stephanie Clancy argued that the attack was a ""substantial or significant"" cause of the postman's death. The jury were told that Burke lived alone behind the post office and would often go to the local petrol station for a snack or a conversation with the staff. During a regular visit on August 8, 2021, Clancy argued that he was the victim of a ""shameful"" attack after being falsely accused by Maskell of being a paedophile. At around 12.40pm, Burke was seen chatting with an attendant at Strathmerton service station, Brenton North. Soon after, Maskell's wife, Fiona Taylor, and his 10-year-old daughter entered the shop and were said to be behaving strangely. North told the jury that he ""wanted to serve them and get them out the shop"" as quickly as possible. The witness said that Burke greeted the young girl and asked how she was when Taylor accused him of being a paedophile. “She said he was looking at the girl, John just seemed shocked by it all,” North added. He recounted that Maskell entered and asked if there was a problem to which Burke replied 'no'. The rest of the encounter is captured on CCTV as a few seconds later, Maskell grabs a 1L sports drink bottle and lobs it at the elderly man's head. The attacker then kicks Burke's hip and he falls to the floor in agony as Maskell continues to shout at him. North told the court that as soon as the family left, he checked on the 74-year-old who was conscious but in pain. An ambulance took Burke to a local hospital in pain and with blood pooling from his ear. Doctors found he had suffered a fractured pelvis and subdural haematoma on the left side of his brain. He was transferred to Melbourne Hospital, where doctors discovered his haematoma had increased in size. Burke never left the hospital and died on October 26, 2021. The prosecution are arguing that a reasonable person would know that Maskell's aggressive actions towards the pensioner were dangerous. Meanwhile, Defence barrister Munster said there are ""two fundamental issues in the trial"". She stated: “The real question is whether Mr Maskell is responsible for the death. “The defence's case is those acts were not objectively dangerous.” The trial is ongoing.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/supreme-court-victoria-victoria-police-836220720.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/station-attack-shocking-moment-oap-836218541.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/supreme-court-victoria-victoria-police-836212979.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/supreme-court-victoria-victoria-police-836212982.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/supreme-court-victoria-victoria-police-836212918.jpg",Shocking moment OAP is brutally attacked after he’s falsely accused of being a paedophile weeks before dying in hospital,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23363525/postman-attacked-falsely-accused-paedophile/
"A BEAR launched a daring break-out from a crate onboard a passenger plane at the world's busiest airport. Panicked passengers were forced to stay grounded as specialists rushed to the hold to tranquillise the escaped beast at Dubai International Airport. Bizarre footage shows the airport staff touching the beast almost affectionately as it freely prowls around in the cargo hold before the experts arrive. Iraqi Airways has insisted it was not to blame for the predator's escape, while Iraq's prime minister has ordered an investigation into the blunder. The wild animal is seen wandering freely around the plane 's hold, which was parked at the world's busiest airport that handles up to 1,100 flights a day. Terrified passengers were forced to disembark as specialists sedated the animal and later removed it from the aircraft. The captain allegedly was forced to apologise to disgruntled passengers over the delay. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shayya' Sabbar al Sudani demanded an investigation into the almost-success of the bear's bid for freedom. Iraqi Airways has claimed that it had followed the proper procedures to transport the bear that are approved by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The airline originally said that the bear was being flown from Baghdad to Dubai, however an Iraqi Airways official speaking anonymously confirmed that it was being flown to Baghdad. In a statement, the airline apologised to the passengers of the plane for the delay that was ""beyond the control of the company"". They added: “The delay happened because of a shipment in the cargo hold. Upon arrival to Dubai Airport, the animal escaped the crate specified for its shipment."" The airline withheld the reason for the bear's transportation and any additional details on its welfare. The statement continued: “After checking the plane and making sure there is no damage from this incident the flight returned to Baghdad.” Keeping predatory animals as pets in Iraq especially in Baghdad has become popular among the wealthy. Iraqi authorities have struggled to control the imports of wild animals or to enforce rules to protect them. Baghdad's police force has previously called on citizens to help prevent the dangerous animals being let loose on the city's streets or ending up as exotic meals in restaurants by reporting such cases. It comes as last month, German cops were convinced a lion was prowling the streets of Berlin's suburbs. Hundreds of officers, armed vehicles and helicopters joined ""Operation Lion Hunt"" in a desperate bid to locate the dangerous animal. After an extensive two-day search, no trace of the wild animal was found and police were forced to admit that the ""lioness"" was probably just a wild boar.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bear1-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bear2-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2004-baghdad-iraq-iraqi-airways-836553063.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2022-cancel-change-flights-heading-706034689.jpg",Panic at Dubai airport as bear escapes crate on plane leaving passengers terrified,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23373177/bear-loose-dubai-airport-escape/
"BRITISH tourists headed to Spain have been warned of ""force 7"" winds and 10ft waves that could threaten to close beaches. The holiday hotspot destinations of southern Spain , Majorca and Menorca have been issued a yellow alert over high winds and big swells, according to Spain's met office. As large parts of mainland Spain battle with intense heat , elsewhere strong winds and large waves could lead to red flags on beaches as safety could be a concern. In southern Spain across the Cadiz coast, including Bolonia and Tarifa, Spain's metereological office (AEMET) has warned of ""force 7 winds"" approaching. The easterly winds are expected to be as powerful as 30-40mph. Meanwhile, on the popular islands of Majorca and Menorca, 20-25mph winds are predicted. The high winds will help to whip up swells in the northeast of the islands, which could produce waves of up to 10ft, AEMET warns. The weather warnings come as Spain is expected to be face a heatwave this week as hot, dry air pushes in from Africa. AEMET reported that parts of southern Spain will face highs of 40C and temperatures are expected to peak at 44C on Wednesday. However, the Balearic islands, which include biza, Majorca and Menorca will be the least affected by the heatwave. Only last week, holidaymakers were warned to stay away from four popular beaches after a red flag alert due to heavy rainfall. Cala Mayor, Can Pere Antoni, Ciudad Jardin and Cala Estancia were closed to visitors on Friday after long showers hit Majorca in the night. Despite saddened tourists, its likely many welcomed the rains as a fresh break from the intense Spanish heat. In Majorca, Palma University marked the heaviest rainfall on the island, with 17 litres per square metre overnight. Portocolom and Alfàbia tied with 16 litres per square metre, but Ibiza beat Majorca with at least 72 litres of rain per square metre falling at Ibiza airport.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2aewbke-dramatic-storm-clouds-approaching-836607189.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ek23wc-mahon-menorca-spain-836607201.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/menorca-balearic-islands-spain-mediterranean-836607198.jpg",Spain holiday warning as yellow alert issued over ‘Force 7’ winds and 10ft waves that could close beaches,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23374578/spain-warning-winds-waves-beaches/
"THIS is the moment a WWE-style brawl broke out on an Alabama waterfront as a woman was smashed over her head with a folding chair. The shocking footage was captured by a witness who said the fight started over an argument about a boat that was blocking the dock as another was trying to moor. In the clip shared on social media , the terrifying scenes of violence have left viewers stunned as the groups of people battled each other to the ground. Men are seen throwing punches and swinging kicks at one another, while one woman ends up being smacked over the head with a folding chair as she sits on the floor. The incident footage was shared on Sunday and several people were detained following the mass brawl, The Montgomery Police Department said. The horror video begins by showing the fight breaking out between two men man standing at the end of the Montgomery Riverboat Park boardwalk. The first man swiftly flings off his cap into a crowd of people who are eagerly watching the drama unfold from above. The fight quickly spins out of control as the pair begin punching one another before the second man tackles his opponent to the ground. Soon after, several others rush into the frame to join the chaos. As the drama unfolds, another man can be seen swimming across the river to climb onto the boardwalk to join the scuffle. The footage shows a number of people attempting to split the fight while others beat each other to the ground around the peacekeepers. In another video of the brawl, two large groups of men are seen fighting on a small motorboat moored to the pontoon before a woman is thrown overboard in the vicious attack. Two men are then filmed blowing punches to the head before one gouges the other's eye. Then in a shocking moment, a man can be seen hitting another over the head with a folding chair before he targets a woman crouched on the ground. With a ferocious swipe, he slams the withe chair across her head before being restrained and handcuffed by cops. The crowd watching the scenes unravel can be heard yelling as the fight continues and people begin being arrested. Photos shared on social media appear to show a group of men sitting handcuffed on the boardwalk, with others being led away from the violent scene by officers. Authorities have not released the names of the detained suspects and charges against anyone involved in the fight are pending, police said. This comes after a mass brawl erupted on a Spanish road aptly dubbed Sin Street in the beach town of Sitges, Catalonia. Dramatic footage shows drinkers battering each other with chairs, tables, glass bottles, stools, and metal bars. And in May, a mass brawl broke out at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as travellers threw punches and yanked on each other's hair. Violent scenes show the big group of travellers pushing each other to the ground and red braids from one woman's hair can be spotted on the floor after she manages to get up.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/08a00f43-7601-48fc-b6d1-3d0259da6e29-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/c3d0634a-9a83-4ed4-8d84-88bac9b2164c.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/55e0e7e1-35d5-467e-a3de-6d76f5bed8af-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/062cad11-34a9-43ef-a99d-9f1fa3e15995-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fa879d2f-f459-4f0b-abfe-1b039fbda6bd.jpg",Massive WWE-style brawl breaks out on Alabama waterfront as woman smashed over head with folding chair in parking row,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23375168/wwe-style-brawl-alabama-waterfront-parking-row/
"A HOMEOWNER went to new heights to block out his nosy neighbour - but it only enraged her more. In return for raising his privacy fence, Adrian Araujo discovered that his ""PsychoKaren"" neighbour had secretly taken her revenge at night. The Texas resident has had a long-running dispute with his neighbours, whom he exclusively refers to as the the tropes of ""Karen"" and ""Kevin"". He regularly takes to TikTok to rally against their petty actions. Initially, Adrian built a wooden fence to further separate their lives, but it wasn't tall enough for him to feel free of their stares. In a recent video , he showed himself raising the height of the fence - a decision that clearly infuriated his neighbours. Adrian shows the ""before"" footage of the fresh and pretty wooden fence he had only just erected and then stitches it with ""after"" shots of the same fence. Baffled, Adrian finds the nice golden tones of the new wood have turned to a bland, grey colour. When he consults his CCTV cameras, he discovers that his neighbour was responsible. She had allegedly spent over 20 minutes splashing heavy streams of water through the holes for seemingly no reason except to damage his side of the fence. ""Karen still watering,"" he captions her bizarre actions. The video, which has been liked almost half a million times, garnered plenty of comments from users outraged by the neighbour. One said: ""I don't understand people like this. Like that is someone's home! Just be decent for christs sake."" ""Sad they have to continually mess with you when you both now have more privacy thanks to YOU!"" another said. Adrian responded: ""[She] already came over, she made cause now she can't see what we do."" ""Send her a thank you note for watering your grass especially during this drought,"" a user joked. Another responded: ""You have to give the neighbours credit for the stamina they have to do this."" It comes a fellow Texas man, who had recently adopted a friendly dog, was shocked by the barbaric move his neighbour made. Brandon Gauntt adopted pup Sky, who has an odd hobby - she likes to climb fences and walk along the tops. Meanwhile, a woman has told of how she had the last laugh after claiming her neighbours harassed her into building a new garden fence.

"GRACE MILLANE was murdered in 2018 after going on a Tinder date while travelling in New Zealand. The British tourist was killed by the evil Jesse Kempson when she was just 21 years old. Jesse Kempson is the man who strangled Grace Millane to death. The pair met on a Tinder date in Auckland , New Zealand on December 1 2018 - the day before Grace's 22nd birthday. Police began hunting for Grace after she failed to reply to birthday messages and her parents became concerned. Her body was then found in a buried in a suitcase , in the Waitakere Ranges. Grace had been six weeks into her backpacking ""trip of a lifetime"" when she met Kempson, and had travelled to New Zealand from South America . He was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 17 years. A jury unanimously found Kempson guilty on November 22, 2019, following a two-week trial. The trial at Auckland High Court heard how Kempson was a fantasist who would tell potential sexual partners that he had celebrity connections, had been orphaned, and even had cancer . He also lied to police during his first interview, claiming he and Grace had parted ways after drinking together for two hours. The final CCTV of Grace placed her at Kempson's hotel where he lived full time, with him, at 9.40pm the evening she disappeared. Incriminating phone data showed he had used Google to browse websites for large duffel bags, suitcases and car hire to dispose of Grace's body after she died. He also searched online for information on "" flesh-eating birds "", asking ""are there vultures in New Zealand?"", as well as ""the hottest fire"", ""large bags near me"" and ""Waitakere Ranges"". It was later revealed that Kempson had raped another British tourist eight months before Grace's death and was convicted of a series of offences against a former partner. Similar to how he acted with Grace, Kempson took his victim out on a Tinder date before bringing her back to his Auckland motel room. Jesse Kempson 's name was protected due to a suppression order issued by New Zealand courts, though the reasons for his name being withheld were not made public at the time. It was later revealed Kempson faced two other trials for violent sexual offences against two women after his trial over the death of Grace. His name was hidden to avoid biasing the judge in the following cases, allowing him a fair trial. He was found guilty of all nine charges at both judge-alone trials and given a 11-year jail term, which will be served concurrently with his sentence for Grace's murder. The ban was continued after his sentencing as Kempson immediately launched an appeal. But on December 22, 2020, the identification ban was lifted when he lost his appeal against his murder conviction. Justice Simon Moore handed Kempson a life imprisonment sentence - with a minimum of 17 years behind bars - at the Auckland High Court on February 21, 2020. During Kempson's trial, Crown solicitor Brian Dickey told the jury that the killer had strangled Grace for five to ten minutes during or after sex, and then ""eroticised"" her death by taking intimate photos of her body. He said: ""At some point... she lost consciousness and would have become limp and lifeless, and he would have carried on. ""That is reckless intent."" Kemper launched an appeal against his life sentence on August 6, 2020, claiming that taking pictures of Grace's dead body and watching porn after brutally murdering her didn't make him a monster. Rachael Reed, Kempson's new lawyer, argued he didn’t get a fair trial and his sentence was too harsh. His appeal was dismissed. Kempson is serving his life sentence at Auckland Prison, having exhausted his routes to having his conviction overturned when he lost another appeal in June 2021 . The prison facility he is being held at in Paremoremo, Auckland , aims at rehabilitating rather than punishing offenders. Opened in 2018, it was designed to provide inmates with more ""humane conditions"" and facilities that include individual TVs, personal showers, and kiosks to order birthday cards, snacks and drinks. In December 2020, it was reported that it was highly likely Kempson would be put on the high-security wing of the £160m jail, but it was understood he'd still have access to most of these facilities.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000626967213.jpg,Who is Grace Millane’s killer Jesse Kempson and where is he now?,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10288934/who-is-grace-millanes-killer-jesse-kempson-and-where-is-he-now/
"A FURIOUS man has warned others that thousands may be denied outside seating in Barcelona - for one harsh reason. Local resident Eudald didn't expect to return home last Monday with an empty stomach after being rejected three-times by restaurants with plenty of free tables. The busyness of the city in summer months has produced, Eudald says, a desperate game of musical chairs to secure a seat outside. And those that are dining alone in Barcelona are in for no chance, he explains. ""I didn't want to go to a specific place, just sit on the first terrace I caught because I wanted to read something while having dinner al fresco,"" he explained. He recalled the curious ruse of excuses and reasons various restaurants on Blai street, the gastro epicentre of a touristy neighbourhood, gave to refuse him a table. “On the first terrace that I got a table, a waiter quickly arrived and told me that it was reserved. It was not. ""As soon as I got up, a group of foreigners who were behind me sat down,"" he explained. ""In the next one, they warned me that I would only have 20 minutes. I specified that I wanted to have dinner, but they insisted that I should do it within that time frame. ""So I got up and in the third and last one, already in the last one on the street because there were a lot of people, they told me directly that the terrace was only for groups."" Elsewhere in the city, Barcelona resident Anna claims to have suffered this exact issue several times. She described how her favourite local bar has let her down in recent months and refused her entry to the terrace alone ""even if there was a free table"". ""The last time I got very upset and told them that if it was a matter of money, I was willing to play their game,"" she added. She asked them what the minimum price she would have to pay to sit on the terrace to have dinner and they allegedly told her that ""I simply could not sit alone"". The disgruntled Barcelona residents' complaints are part of a growing chorus of protest aimed at bars and restaurants for their naughty tactic to secure extra cash. It started to be noticed in 2022, when temperatures began to increase earlier in spring and the visitor levels rebounded post-pandemic. Online, people have began calling out specific bars for this strategy of turning down single diners. Clara Ziegnem tweeted: ""7:43 p.m. and they didn't want to serve us on the terrace of the Sants rice restaurant because 'it was already dinner time' Okay."" Another angry diner, Noemí Vilaseca, railed against the MACBA restaurant turning her away because she only wanted a coffee. Barcelona City Council were alerted to the problem and reportedly went to the hotel and restaurant union to handle it. There has not currently been an official response. It comes as a series of Spain's popular destinations have recently introduced tourist taxes to bolster their finances. Barcelona has already increased its tourist tax price this year and has plans for a further rise next year. Local councils in the Valencia region have been given the go-ahead to apply a charge of up to €2 (£1.75) per person per night. Other cities could soon follow suit, with the capital of Madrid considering a tourist tax of its own.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/view-beach-sea-shore-small-651536710.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hgp29a-barceloneta-beach-w-hotel-670159748.jpg",Warning as thousands of diners face being turned away from restaurants at top tourist hotspot,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23378731/restaurants-holiday-hotspot-turned-away/
"POLICE in the Amazon jungle are probing bizarre claims a village is being menaced by creatures just like Predator. Locals living in the wilds have reported seeing 7ft armoured aliens with large heads and yellow eyes in Peru . The claims have been made by members of the Ikitu indigenous people in the rural district of Alto Nanay, northeast of Lima. And they claim a girl, 15, was attacked by one of the monsters which slashed her neck. Hunters have reportedly fired on the ""creatures"" with their guns - which are said to be immune to human weapons. The beings also allegedly can disappear at will. Theories range from the outlandish such as them being real aliens or creatures from folklore, to the more mundane. It has been suggested the ""beings"" could be drones covered with cloth and masks to scare the locals by illegal miners in a Scooby Doo-style scheme. Others have suggested the sightings could be a case of mass hysteria. Police and the navy are now investigating the claims - with locals calling for a military force to be deployed in the region, which is a 10-hour river ride from Iquitos City. The description of the ""aliens"" appears to be similar to the armoured beast from the Predator franchise. Predators are a species of tribalistic aliens who wear armoured suits and carry blades as they hunt humans. But in the movie, one of the creatures is handily seen off by action star Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Peruvian locals however do not seem to be having as much luck fending off the ""aliens"". Community leaders have said the ""strange beings"" have been menacing them since July 11. Some villagers described the aliens as being like ""pelacaras"", creatures from folklore that feast on human fat and organs. Police took a speedboat and toured the area after the reports of the teenager being attacked. Pictures show the young girl with a bloodied neck - but it is unclear what caused the injuries. And another man is reported to have been wounded in the head by the ""aliens"". Community leader Jairo Reátegui Ávila said in no uncertain terms he believes the ""beings"" are from outer space. And the villagers have set up patrols to try and hunt down the intruders wth shotguns. He compared them to looking like the Green Goblin from the Spider-Man franchise - who in some versions appears armoured with yellow eyes. “I shot one of them twice and he wasn’t injured, he rose and disappeared. “We’re very frightened about what’s happening here in our community.” He added: “Their shoes are round-shaped, which they use to float. They float about one metre from the ground and there is a red light on the heel. “Their heads are long, they wear a mask and their eyes are yellowish. ""They are experts at escaping. ""We want military support to protect us, as well as local and regional authorities."" Peruvian ufologist Anthony Choy claimed he had heard of accounts from across the Amazon about the so-called ""aliens"". He stated he had heard there was a report from the city of Pucallpa of three boys being ""attacked with laser beams"". And he claimed there was a similar report from the town of Contamana. But he speculated this may be a case of mass hysteria - with real stories being embellished. He suggested reports of human traffickers may be becoming intertwined with folklore and reports of alien abductions. ""There are legends that speak of the so-called ‘peelers’ who are a kind of mythical characters,"" he explained. ""That is what the communities constantly repeat."" According to a 2017 national census, there are around 1,350 people who identify as being a member of the Ikitu community. UFOs and talk of aliens have become increasingly mainstream after a high-profile hearing led by US politicians in Washington.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/someone-injured-one-reported-alien-836620505.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/d12fb59e-e331-405a-a2fc-2992cfa87b57.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000000290052.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/15e06ec9-97dc-4267-89cc-6bf099787359.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dd050f26-de26-471f-af3f-a61bb9a7afb3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/someone-injured-one-reported-alien-836620600.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/22426378-45f4-45d2-affa-66683316234b.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000770392162.jpg",Cops probe claims villagers being terrorised by ‘Predator-style ALIENS’ after girl has neck slashed by mystery ‘beast’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23379214/predator-aliens-villagers-terrosied-girl-slashed/
"TWO British tourists have been accused of tipping a Spanish mum off her lounger at a Canary Island resort as Spain's sunbed wars turn nasty. A family of holidaymakers in Fuerteventura say they're going to the cops after a mum and her two daughters were allegedly attacked by the hotel pool. They claim the 53-year-old mum of two was tipped out of her sunbed by the two Brit men, in their 60s and 30s, who said she had nabbed their spot. ""We were afraid,"" said the Spanish family. Canary newspaper Diario de Avisos says Civil Guard officers attended the unnamed hotel to calm the situation down and to split the parties up. Sunbed wars have been making headlines over the summer season with reports of tourists claiming their sunbeds very early in the morning or last thing at night , ""reserving"" them with towels and leaving them empty for hours on end. Diario de Avisos says the latest ""violent episode"" brought ""hammock wars"" to the limit in the Canary Islands. The alleged attack took place on Monday when according to the Spanish man, his wife and his two daughters, 18 and 22, decided to go to the pool while he took a nap. The woman, who ""doesn't know any English"", sat on an empty sun lounger, and suddenly two British men ""started insulting her"" and claimed she had stolen their sunbed. The older Brit allegedly overturned her hammock, which fell on her foot, says her husband. ""She got scared and didn't understand what was happening"", he told Diario de Avisos - and neither did her daughters who were allegedly pushed. He said other hotel guests who were in the pool at the time immediately criticised the violent attitude of the two men. ""I went down and two seconds later the Civil Guard arrived, which separated everyone,"" he said. Details of all parties involved were taken. The family said they refused to stay in the hotel as they were scared and asked to be moved to a different hotel instead. They say they will be filing an official complaint when they return to their home in Albacete on the Spanish mainland. They will also be seeking a medical report on the mother, saying she has suffered ankle and back pain. The hotel declined to make a comment to the Spanish newspaper. This comes after sunbed hoggers in Benidorm face a tough new crackdown after a war erupted between Brits and locals over beach loungers. And tourists in Torremolinos are taking sunbed wars to a new extreme as they rush to claim loungers before the pool is even open.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000825391049.jpg,"Brit sunbed warriors TIPPED ME out of my poolside spot – now I’m going to the cops, says Spanish mum",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23380163/brit-sunbed-warriors-going-to-cops-spanish-mum/
"A HOLIDAY warning has been issued as a horrific ""biblical"" plague of bugs forces tourists to flee their beach resorts. Dozens of holidaymakers have been forced to pack up and leave their hotels as millions of grasshoppers have invaded an entire coastline. Horror footage of the ""biblical"" event was recorded on beaches across the Romagna Riviera, on the southern coast of Italy . Many tourists have reportedly fled after their stay was cut short by the pesky insects that swarmed the area between Bellaria Igea marina, San Mauro Mare, and Cesenatico, because of the deafening row that went on all day and night. Several tourists filmed the sudden insect invasion that is said to be getting worse by the day, leaving both visitors and tourists unable to sleep. One nightmare clip shows a tourist's balcony and the whole outside of the next-door building covered in large, noisy grasshoppers. Their loud chirping echoes through the entire neighbourhood, disturbing holidaymakers who reportedly decided it was time to head back home. Another clip shows the insects taking over a beach as they are seen covering the sand, the sunbeds, and the umbrellas. The beach seems largely empty after apparently being abandoned by horrified bathers trying to escape the grisly insect storm. The infestation of grasshoppers is believed to have arrived after strong gusts of the Garbino wind that have hit the area in recent days. The Garbino - a southwestern wind from northern Africa that brings Saharan sand as it blows - is what most likely pushed the insects to move from the countryside to the coast, local experts said. Beach lifeguards described the rare event as a ""surprise that was not needed"" and one they hope will end as soon as possible. This comes after Brits holidaying in Spain last summer were warned that they could face a plague of mosquitos , cockroaches, and bedbugs during a 43C heatwave. And in 2019, a huge swarm of ravenous locusts were caught on film completely blanketing the skies over a Saudi Arabian city. The deluge of biblical bugs - which numbered in the tens of millions - descended on Najran in May of that year.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo-shows-grasshoppers-building-invasion-836618456.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/45f68d5d-3f63-4395-a198-9730582a00cb.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo-shows-grasshoppers-building-invasion-836618467.jpg",Holiday warning as ‘biblical’ plague of bugs forces tourists to flee beach resorts,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23380962/holiday-warning-biblical-plague-bugs-beach-resorts/
"A MUM claims she was denied entry to a beach club over her tiny back tattoo. Katie Hally had planned a night out to celebrate her friend's birthday on the Gold Coast when she was called back to the bar entrance by security. After going back and speaking with the bouncer of Burleigh Pavilion, Katie was told she couldn't enter due to the venue's ""tattoo policy"". The tattoo in question was three Chinese letters reading ""family, love and happiness"" stretching from her back to bottom of her neck. The manager then asked mum Katie to leave and return when she had covered up. The venue's policy states guests with tattoos can enter unless they are ""intimidating, aggressive or offensive"". Katie explained: ""I understand why the policy exists, but the manager could have used her discretion, she could have been more caring and assess people on a case-by-case basis but they didn't. ""I got the first one – happiness – almost thirteen years ago after I got divorced. The second one, 'family' I got done with my sister and the third one I did last, 'love', in the hopes I could find love again."" It's not the first time the venue has asked others to leave due to their tattoos - last year, a Maori woman was refused entry as well due to her tattooed face. The woman's traditional chin tattoo had a deeper meaning for her culture - a ""manifestation"" of her identity. Burleigh Pavilion told The Sun: ""The Burleigh Pavilion has contacted Gold Coast resident, Katie Hally to apologise for being refused entry to the venue over the weekend. ""Management became aware of the incident after media reports and acknowledge that in accordance with its policy, Katie should have been welcomed into the venue. ""Burleigh Pavilion’s house policy is in place to create a comfortable and enjoyable environment for our guests."" Meanwhile, one man shared the tattoo he got as a 16 year old which he regrets now. Taking to social media , one woman went up to the man in question and asked: “What’s your biggest tattoo regret?” Dressed in a Nike T-shirt and a pair of black trousers while designing a tattoo on a tablet, he turned to the camera before lifting his shirt. Showing a quote tattooed onto his rib cage, he said: “Where there’s a will, there’s a way”. The writing turned into a blob over time as the ink in the thick letters melded together. But this isn’t the reason he has major regret as the woman asked him: “Is it because your name is William?” To which he responded: “Yeah,” before laughing hysterically. He added: “I thought I was 16 and bada**,” before slapping his hand down on his leg. People flocked to the comments section to share their thoughts on the hilarious fail as one person wrote: “I wish my tattoo regret was this good,” followed by a crying with laughter emoji. The Sun has contacted Burleigh Pavilion for comment.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836668133.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836668134.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836668137.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836668132.jpg",I was refused entry to beach club over tiny back tattoo – bouncers claimed it was offensive but you can barely see it,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23381756/refused-entry-club-offensive-tattoo-bouncers-mom/
"THE woman who cooked a meal which resulted in the deaths of three people has denied any wrongdoing. Erin Patterson hosted a lunch with her former in-laws, Gail and Don Patterson - and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson plus her husband Ian. The family gathered at Erin's home in Victoria, Australia for the dinner last week, which ended in tragedy. After eating the meal, the guests became violently ill with three later dying - thought to be due to poisonous mushrooms. Gail and Heather, aged 70 and 66, died on Friday and Don, 70, died on Saturday night. Cops have launched a probe as they do not know if the case is suspicious. Homicide detectives have said Erin is a person of interest since she cooked the meal and did not have symptoms of poisoning. Victoria Police Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said: ""She hasn't presented with any symptoms but we have to keep an open mind in relation to this, that it could be very innocent but again we just don't know at this point."" She allegedly did not answer questions about where the mushrooms came from or what meal she made for the guests. Thomas continued: ""We will be working closely with medical experts, toxicologists… in the hope we can understand exactly what has gone on and provide some answers to the family. ""We're trying to understand who ate what at the lunch, whether that person that did not become ill did or did not eat the mushrooms… ""And of course, we're trying to ascertain what it is that has actually caused the poisoning to the four people that attended."" Erin broke down in front of cameras today and claimed she didn't do anything as cops investigate. She said: ""I loved them and I'm devastated that they're gone. ""Gail was like the mum I didn't have because my mum passed away four years ago and Gail had never been anything but good and kind to me. ""Ian and Heather were some of the best people I'd ever met. They never did anything wrong to me."" Meanwhile, Heather’s husband Ian Wilkinson, a pastor, is in the hospital where he is in critical condition. The families told The South Gippsland Sentinel-Times : “The past week has been a time of shock and grief for us all. ""They were parents, grandparents, siblings, children, and pillars of faith within our community.” Locals have been left stunned as news of the deaths emerged. Nathan Hersey, the mayor of South Gippsland, described the situation as ""shocking."" Officials have warned about two types of poisonous mushrooms that grow in Victoria during the cooler months. It’s not known what type of mushroom the four people ate. Symptoms of wild mushroom poisoning include vomiting, diarrhoea, and dizziness.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668391.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668392.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668393.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668390.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668388-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668389.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668387.jpg",Homicide probe as Erin Patterson ‘cooks poisonous mushroom lunch that killed 3 relatives but didn’t fall ill herself’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23381073/mushroom-lunch-murder-mystery-poison-erin-patterson/
"THE Sun joined a Ukraine army drone team calling in heavy artillery strikes on a frontline Russian fortress. The troops had detected the Russian position in an abandoned riverside farmhouse. They watched from their eye-in-the-sky as troops built zig-zagged fortifications and wooden shelters to hide their boats. Vitaliy, the drone pilot, alerted his pals on a US -made M777 Howitzer. He said the mission was organised ""soldier to soldier"" without high-level command. He said: ""If we find a target we call our friends in the artillery and if they can help then they will. ""This time they said we have 10 shots."" We watched as they launched their shop-bought drone from a bombed out office block. The DJI Mavic 3 buzzed through an empty window before they retreated to an inside corridor sheltered from incoming fire. The live feed showed Russian soldiers moving around the building before taking cover inside. Vitaliy said it was possible they might have heard the drone or they may have had electronic warfare systems that detected his aerial vehicle. A text message from the gun crew announced they had fired the first shot. Almost 45 seconds later we heard the blast thunder across the water. The drone feed showed it had hit 600m off target. Vitaliy's comrade Nazar plotted the impact site on a map on his military tablet. Maksim, the third soldier in the team, relayed the coordinates to the gun crew via an encrypted messaging app . They adjusted their aim and fired again. The US-donated M777 Howitzer has a range of more than 13 miles. The seventh shot landed exactly on target. The gunners blasted two more 155mm shells at the base. There was one more to go when a message came through from the gun crew. Nazar said: ""The Russians were shooting back. Our guys on the gun had to take cover."" Both sides use counter battery radars to detect where guns are operating in order to shoot back. He added: ""It was a successful mission. We hit the target.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/196-battalion-drone-team-operating-836146280.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/196-battalion-drone-team-operating-836146199.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/196-battalion-drone-team-operating-836146256.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/196-battalion-drone-team-operating-836145798.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/196-battalion-drone-team-operating-836146492-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/196-battalion-drone-team-operating-836145812.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/196-battalion-drone-team-operating-836146097.jpg",Sun team joins Ukraine’s heroes blitzing Russian troops with shop-bought drones to bust through Putin’s frontline,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23382209/sun-joins-ukraine-blitzing-russian-troops-shop-bought-drones/
"UKRAINE has arrested an alleged Russian informant after foiling a plot to kill President Volodymr Zelensky, the SBU announced. The nation's security service said the woman was caught ""red-handed"" trying to pass intelligence onto Putin 's regime. The SBU revealed she had been ""gathering intelligence"" on the details of Zelensky 's itinerary ahead of his trip to flood-hit Mykolaiv in July. The Ukrainian President confirmed he had been informed about the shop assistant's arrest and the evil plot to eliminate him. He said the head of the security service had kept him in the loop about the ""fight against traitors"". The unnamed woman was pictured surrounded by masked SBU agents in a kitchen as she was detained. Moscow has not yet commented on the incident. The woman had been trying to find out information regarding Zelensky's schedule for his trip to the southern region, the SBU said. He first toured the city in June to inspect the damage after the Nova Kakhovka dam burst , before returning the following month after heavy Russian shelling. The suspect is alleged to have been collecting information on the locations the President planned to visit and at what time. It is claimed she planned to pass on the info to Putin's goons, who were preparing a ""massive airstrike on the Mykolaiv region"". Zelensky was the target of the planned attack, a spokesperson for the SBU confirmed to NBC News. The security service said it was made aware of the plot before the President's visit and additional security measures were put in place. The woman was not arrested at the time as the SBU wanted to learn more about her alleged Russian handlers. Agents began trailing her in the hopes of gathering more intelligence on the ""assignments received"". The suspect is alleged to have attempted to share sensitive information with Russia regarding top-secret locations. This includes the coordinates of electronic warfare systems and warehouses used to stash ammunition. She lived in a small town called Ochakiv - where Zelensky visited last month - and had been working in a shop at a military base there. According to the statement from the SBU, the woman had taken pictures and video of military facilities in Ukraine. The suspect now faces up to 12 years behind bars if found guilty of the alleged assassination plot that was thwarted. She is expected to face charges of unauthorised dissemination of information about the movements of weapons and troops. It comes after claims emerged that Putin gave mutinous Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin orders to assassinate Zelensky . He was meant to go straight into exile as part of a deal to halt his march on Moscow - but was welcomed into the Kremlin on June 29. It was reported that Prigozhin could try to launch a ""great atrocity"" on Putin's behalf - which could include a mission to ""bring back Volodymyr Zelensky's head"".","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ukraines-security-service-says-woman-836681411.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-irish-taoiseach-leo-varadkar-832761905.jpg",Moment woman ‘caught red handed’ in evil plot to ‘assassinate Zelensky & feed info to Putin’ during Ukraine war,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23382904/woman-arrested-plot-assassinate-zelensky-feed-info-putin/
"A DAIRY boss has been crushed to death by 15,000 wheels of cheese after a shelf collapsed on top of him at his factory. Giacomo Chiapparini, 74, was found buried underneath his own produce at his warehouse in Italy 's northern Lombardy region. Thousands of wheels of a Parmesan-style hard cheese - weighing around 40kg each - battered the businessman on Sunday night. A shelf supporting the hefty dairy products collapsed at around 9pm, triggering a deadly domino effect that brought down 15,000 wheels. Giacomo had been working inside the factory in the small town of Romano di Lombardia near Bergamo at the time. He is said to have been checking on the ripening wheels that were stored on a network of metal shelves that were up to 33ft tall. Italian outlet Corriere della Sera reported that he was activating a robot which carries out the cleaning process of maturing cheese. A 118-strong rescue team, made up of firefighters and paramedics,  worked through the night to find the grandad. They ""had to move the cheeses and the shelves by hand"" during the gruelling 12-hour mission to locate Giacomo. The award-winning cheesemaker's body was eventually found at around 9am the following morning, firefighter Antonio Dusi told AFP. He leaves behind his beloved wife, two children and several grandchildren. Italian cops have now launched an investigation into the freak accident and are trying to reconstruct Giacomo's final moments. The warehouse contained a total of 25,000 wheels of Grana Padano, a hard cheese which resembles Parmesan that is very popular in Italy. Giacomo had worked in the industry his entire life, his daughter Mary previously said. The dairy boss worked on his father's farm as a sharecropper alongside his brother, before buying his own farm in 1977.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-cheese-wheels-collapsed-top-836669998.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-cheese-wheels-collapsed-top-836669580.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-cheese-wheels-collapsed-top-836690402-1.jpg","Dairy boss found crushed to death under 15,000 wheels of cheese after factory shelf collapsed on top of him in Italy",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23382834/dairy-boss-crushed-death-thousands-wheels-of-cheese-italy/

"THOUSANDS of holidaymakers and locals have been forced to flee as raging wildfires rip through Portugal. More than 800 firefighters are battling a raging inferno near the southern town of Odemir a as it spreads towards the Algarve - one of Portugal's top tourist destinations. Teams were aided by 16 water-bombing aircraft which attempted to extinguish the ferocious flames from above. Nine firefighters have been injured as the blaze scorched some 6,700 hectares of the countryside just south of Lisbon . So far, around 1,400 people have been evacuated from 19 villages in the area - just 50 miles from popular beach resorts. And officials are expected to declare a state of emergency as the wind carries the fire further. Odemira's mayor, Helder Guerreiro, has said the situation is ""critical, difficult, and complex"". Civil Protection commander Jose Ribeiro said there was a ""lot of work"" ahead to bring the wildfire under control. A second wildfire erupted close to the city of Castelo Branco and also incinerated around 7,000 hectares of land. More than 1,100 firefighters and 14 water-carrying planes battled the blaze in hot and windy conditions. It spread to the Fatima Sanctuary - about 60 miles away from where hundreds of thousands gathered to see Pope Francis on Saturday. Fire services in Portugal are extremely stretched, as another blaze was reported to have broken out in Ourém on Sunday morning. Around 325 firefighters, 100 vehicles, and five water bombers were said to be on the scene. The Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere (IPMA) warned the districts of Beja and Faro are also at risk. Have you been affected by the wildfires in Portugal? Get in touch at  imogen.braddick@thesun.co.uk or WhatsApp +447741005808 In the centre of the country, other fires sparked the closure of several stretches of motorway, including parts of the A1 between Lisbon and Porto . Authorities said more than 120 areas across Portugal are facing a severe risk of wildfires. Ruben del Campo of the Spanish state weather agency said this week's weather will be more ""intense, widespread and a little longer lasting"" than July. Temperatures are still often topping 40C in Portugal as the summer heat continues. Lisbon has been added to the list of cities and towns under a ""red alert"" weather warning. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world , and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. It comes weeks after wildfires erupted across Greece , forcing over 20,000 holidaymakers and locals to flee. The fierce blaze broke out on July 18 in Rhodes and quickly spread to the eastern and southern coast - an area with many beach resorts. Greek officials said it was the biggest evacuation effort the country had ever faced.

"A WIFE who was allegedly ""held captive for 12 years and locked in a torture room"" has been found - as her husband is arrested. The woman, 53, who hasn't been named, was discovered in her bedroom at an apartment in the town of Forbach , near the German border, by cops on Monday. She claims she was kidnapped by her husband, 55, back in 2011. The woman was reportedly only finally able to escape after being able to get hold of a mobile phone and calling German police on Sunday. German officers alerted French authorities in the Moselle part of the country before a search was quickly launched. Germany's Bild newspaper said the husband refused police entry before they eventually had to force their way in. Three cops then uncovered the horror. Local media reports said the woman was found trapped in one room - which was allegedly fenced off with metal wire - semi-naked, with a shaved head, and indications her fingers and legs were broken. It's also understood she hadn't been fed for some time as medical examinations found her in ""not good"" health. Her husband was arrested on Monday morning on suspicion of kidnap and torture. He remains in police custody while investigations are being carried out. Neighbours told how they heard a woman's screams coming from the flat and when they questioned the man, he told them his wife had cancer and was in pain. One local said: ""We never saw the women. ""He told us that she had cancer and was screaming because of her illness, the pain."" Erika, another witness who lives in a nearby street, told AFP she last saw the woman ""maybe 10 years ago"" and thought ""maybe she had died or moved out"". French media reports also said cops found a diary-type notebook in the flat. It is believed the man kept a record of his actions, including the times he gave his wife food.

"A BRITISH man has been arrested after allegedly groping another UK tourist at a hotel in Magaluf. The 48-year-old reportedly approached the 20-year-old woman from behind and put his hands down her trousers. The alleged victim, who was staying at the same hotel as the man in the popular Spanish resort, told police he was a stranger she had never met before. A hotel receptionist alerted police who arrested the suspect shortly after arriving at the hotel. Cops have now passed the case over to the Civil Guard. It was not immediately clear if the suspect has already appeared in court and whether he has been released on bail. It comes after two Irish holidaymakers were arrested on suspicion of raping a British woman in a hotel in Magaluf last month. The pair were held at Palma Airport on July 19 as they were preparing to board a flight to Dublin . They were remanded in prison pending an ongoing investigation. And in July, a Brit holidaymaker was arrested at Palma Airport after allegedly raping his girlfriend at their hotel on the island. The man was held as he tried to fly home after his partner said he forced himself on her in the bathroom of their hotel room. The couple are said to have been staying at a three-star hotel near the resort of Magaluf. In May, a British tourist was arrested on suspicion of raping a female friend of his son’s at a hotel in Magaluf. The holidaymaker was also held at Palma Airport after allegedly packing his bags and trying to leave the island in a hurry hours later. The woman, also believed to be British, told detectives she was forced to have sex after falling asleep in her friend’s room which had an internal door leading into his dad’s room.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2014-mallorca-spain-magaluf-one-325809439.jpg,"Female Brit tourist, 20, ‘groped by UK holidaymaker at Magaluf hotel’ as cops arrest man, 48, over ‘sexual assault’",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23385056/brit-tourist-groped-uk-holidaymaker-magaluf/
"THIS is the last heart-wrenching snap of a little boy who was fatally poisoned after he dived into a pile of toxic building dust. Arthur Emanuel Bitencourt, seven, was photographed posing with his thumbs up while sitting in the pile of deadly limestone powder. Only moments later he was fighting for his life in a deadly reaction to breathing in the common building material . Arthur had reportedly jumped into the powder at a family property in Ipiranga, southern Brazil , on August 3. His family rushed the young lad to hospital but he was tragically declared dead upon arrival. According to local media, medics have attributed Arthur's death to inhalation of the dust he had just been playing in. Limestone dust contains tiny silica particles that can cause severe breathing problems if inhaled, and even death. His devastated family has shared the photo across social media to share the dangers of limestone powder. Family member Romaldo Bitencourt said in a post on Facebook : ""This photo was the last and taken a few minutes before his tragic death, caused by inhaling limestone, while playing. ""The memories I will have of you, my dear child, will always be the best. ""'Our gratitude to GOD for putting Arthur in our life a treasure, who stayed with us for seven years, one month and ten days."" Local police have opened an investigation into the boy's death, as the family said they were unaware of the dangers involved with the material. Brazil's Technological Research Institute says limestone powder - widely used in building and gardening - can cause breathing problems. Limestone used in a crushed or pebble sized form does not cause health issues, but when powdered it can cause health hazards. Anyone exposed to it is advised to wear protective equipment, as the tiny silica particles in the dust can cause lung cancer , pulmonary disease , kidney disease and silicosis. Young Arthur was buried on August 4, only a day after his untimely death. Last year, a nine-year-old boy was horrifically sliced to death after tripping and falling onto a sawmill conveyor belt in Brazil. Hudson Adriano Hellmann was playing near the machine at the site in Rio do Campo, Brazil when the tragedy occurred. It is not clear why he was playing so close to the dangerous machine or if he was playing with other children at the time.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836616650.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/marlene-arthur-bitencourt-taken-marlene-836765733.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/arthur-bitencourt-taken-romaldo-bitencourts-836765615.jpg","Heartbreaking final photo shows boy, 7, sitting in pile of building material that poisoned him to death moments later",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23385166/picture-boy-dust-pile-poison-limestone-death/
"A FIRM offering tourists illegal booze cruises in a Brit holiday hot spot has been hit with a six-figure fine. Magaluf council chiefs said the party bosses in question were caught “red-handed” as they escorted around 130 tourists on a boat. After being discovered, the unnamed company was fined nearly £140,000 for the breach in law . The tourists had paid around £40 each to ride on the party cruise where loud music was played and alcohol served. Calvia Council chief Juan Feliu described the party boat breach: “The company has been caught red-handed by local police escorting customers on to a party boat. The evidence is irrefutable. “We are not going to allow our municipality to be identified with drunken tourism.” Calvia Council explained: “Local police have detailed in a report how around 130 people were boarding a boat at the jetty in Magaluf after paying an entry ticket of £40. “Some of the paying customers were clearly under the influence of alcohol when they were boarding. “Aboard officers were able to confirm the sale of alcohol, with a blackboard with prices written on them and beer pumps. “Below deck they found unmarked bottles of alcohol and plastic containers filled with booze. Musical equipment for a party was also discovered."" The jaw dropping fine was handed out to the company following a pioneering crackdown which ended pub crawls , happy hours and 2 for 1 cheap drink offers in the party destination. The crackdown also suspended the concession of new ""party boat"" licences, which also banned boats which were already licensed from embarking or disembarking tourists in popular areas. An agreement between Calvia Council which covers Magaluf and a local boat owners’ association had already been signed in 2018, designed to stop the jetty in the resort being used by party boats. The Calvia Council continued: ""Magaluf is included in the area covered by regional government decree 1/2020, against drunken tourism to improve quality in some holiday areas. “As a result of the police action the company responsible for offering these booze cruises has been fined £138,500."" In another Spanish resort town, locals have revealed how every summer their town becomes a total nightmare because of drunken tourists. The quaint village of Arenal, in Majorca , suffers from troublemaker tourists with boozy Brits being dubbed ""worst"" of them all. Many Spanish cities set strict new rules for smokers last year introducing a smoking ban in popular beaches such as Barcelona , Lanzarote and Tenerife as they fight against pesky tourists. Barcelona introduced a smoking ban on all of its beaches last year with those breaking the rules facing strict fines of up to £25.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/d5ah8a-drinking-games-party-boat-554957357.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/banned-promoting-excessive-consumption-alcohol-395044283.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/c9a0m9-group-young-tourists-boat-816359320.jpg","Urgent Spain holiday warning as crackdown on boat parties and pub crawls sees massive £140,000 fine handed down",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23386368/holiday-warning-crackdown-booze-cruise-fine-magaluf-spain/
"YOU have 20/20 vision if you can spot the stealthy snow leopard stalking the mountains for prey in this rocky setting. A hidden predator has been caught on camera in this optical illusion , proving that it is the ultimate master of disguise. In the puzzling snap that will have you looking twice, the snow leopard can be seen blending itself into its rocky surroundings and even a grassy plane as it stalks its prey. In the mind-bending images taken by Fabio Nodari, an Italian travel photographer, the leopard can also be seen tucking into a feast - but can you spot it? Fabio, 38, said: ""The pictures and video were taken in Sichuan Province, China , in a remote area that is home to many endangered species such as white-lipped deer and snow leopards. ""I was traveling with other photographers , and we were lucky enough to spot the snow leopard a couple of days after arriving at the shooting location. ""Finding an area where a herd of blue sheep were peacefully grazing on the side of the mountain helped to find the possible hunting ground of the snow leopard."" Fabio, who currently lives in Yunnan, China, explained that people who've seen the photographs have been shocked that he managed to spot a snow leopard in the first place. He added: ""Many people are surprised that I actually had the chance to see one in real life. They are extremely difficult to spot due to the remoteness of the places they live in and the fact that only a few thousand of them are left. ""When it comes to spotting rare wildlife, the secret is finding a local guide who is familiar with the environment. In China, this is particularly important because the guide will also help to deal with the local people who are often suspicious of foreigners."" Fabio added that he took the photographs at a safe distance so that the animal wasn't disturbed and advised anyone looking to follow in his footsteps to have lots of patience. He said: ""I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the snow leopard. ""Seeing the hunting ground in real-time, looking at the snow leopard while it was prowling, hiding, and trying to get to its prey was the most incredible photographic experience of my life"". Don't worry if you're still struggling to spot the predator though, as we have the solution below. If you adjust your eyes to the top middle section of the rocky slope, you just might find something suspicious. Did you manage to spot it? If you found this optical illusion too easy - or too hard - then why not give these fun puzzles a go? You have 20/20 vision if you can spot the mouse recorded on the night cam in less than 30 seconds. Or test your eyesight with this game and see if you can spot the hidden boxes of popcorn in this colourful image.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stealthy-snow-leopard-caught-camera-836755458.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stealthy-snow-leopard-caught-camera-836755301.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stealthy-snow-leopard-caught-camera-836755415.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stealthy-snow-leopard-caught-camera-836755472.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stealthy-snow-leopard-caught-camera-836755297.jpg",You have 20/20 vision if you can spot the stealthy snow leopard stalking the mountains for prey,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23389509/20-vision-spot-snow-leopard-stalking-mountains-prey/
"TWO young women were left horrified when the Airbnb they booked turned out to have creepy hidden rooms, peepholes, and even secret tunnels. Tierra Burris and Scarlet Wolf reserved the ""cute girly"" residence for two weeks - but were stunned by what they found. They took to TikTok to share their experience after arriving at the odd property in Portland , Oregon , Tierra said: ""There are strange tunnels, holes and ways [into] this home."" The weird experience began when the owners of the home provided the wrong address to the two women. In a TikTok, Tierra said: ""They gave us an address for place that does not exist and said we cannot use the front door. ""So let's go to object number one. There are strange tunnels, holes, and ways to this home. ""This one specifically has a big open space large enough for a human."" Tierra filmed other areas in the weird home, including doors that didn't close and had locks on the outside. Several closets had ""secret tunnels"" inside, and in the yard, the pair found an extra key to enter the home. The wardrobe in one room had a hole drilled into it which peered into the other bedroom. Shockingly, the basement had a man-sized tunnel: ""Mind you we’re in Portland , Oregon, right now where there’s an active serial killer on the loose.” Despite the creepiness of the property, Tierra said the home had beautiful original hardwood floors and newly renovated showers. The owner of the home reportedly told the pair: ""It's a recently renovated old Portland home. We wanted to keep its charm and quirks."" Tierra joked: ""You mean the murder room in the basement there?"" The pair paid £2,750 for their stay in the large, albeit creepy, home, but were given a refund later by Airbnb . Referencing the tunnels, they said: ""We're not going in there. We never will."" Viewers of Tierra's TikTok were shocked at the property's quirks, and many pleaded with Airbnb to refund the girls. One viewer said: ""I’m mostly concerned about the extra key outside and the room that has a peephole to the bedroom."" Another suggested: ""A lot of that is normal for old homes . Maybe not the peephole but it's probably for electrical cords to come through the back to be unseen.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/50b0864b-4477-4efd-9149-0a236fa8c11a.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-tiktok-com-tierrasaurusrex-video-836790039.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-tiktok-com-tierrasaurusrex-video-836790123.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-instagram-com-p-cvktr0via04-836790030.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-tiktok-com-tierrasaurusrex-video-836790126.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/www-tiktok-com-tierrasaurusrex-video-836790021.jpg","Inside ‘horror’ Airbnb with creepy tunnels, peepholes, secret rooms and hidden closets that’s freaking out guests",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23388515/horror-secret-air-bnb-tunnels-peepholes-rooms-tiktok/
"THE ex-husband of a woman who cooked a deadly mushroom lunch said he ""almost died"" from a mystery stomach illness last year. Erin Patterson invited Gail and Don Patterson, her former in-laws, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson and her husband Ian to her home in Leongatha, Australia . After eating the meal - which allegedly included poisonous mushrooms - the guests became violently ill and Gail, 70, Heather, 66, and Don, 70, later died. Ian, a pastor, remains in hospital in a critical condition. Erin's ex Simon Patterson - the son of Don and Gail - has now revealed that he almost died in May last year from a mystery illness. He said he collapsed at home and was placed into an induced coma. In a social media post, Simon wrote: ""I collapsed at home, then was in an induced coma for 16 days through which I had three emergency operations mainly on my small intestine, plus an additional planned operation. ""My family were asked to come and say goodbye to me twice, as I was not expected to live. ""I was in intensive care for 21 days..."" It’s believed Simon coached U16 boys basketball at Poowong. In the post, he thanked his wife, Erin, and their two children for their support. Homicide detectives said Erin is a person of interest since she cooked the meal and did not have symptoms of poisoning. Investigators are still unsure whether she also ate the meal - but cops confirmed a different lunch was served to her two children. Officers have seized a number of items, including a food dehydrator believed to have been used to prepare the mushrooms. A police source told The Age that cops are conducting forensic tests on the dehydrator - which was found at a nearby tip. Victoria Police Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said: ""She hasn't presented with any symptoms but we have to keep an open mind in relation to this, that it could be very innocent but again we just don't know at this point."" She allegedly did not answer questions about where the mushrooms came from or what meal she made for the guests. ""We will be working closely with medical experts, toxicologists… in the hope we can understand exactly what has gone on and provide some answers to the family,"" Thomas added. ""We're trying to understand who ate what at the lunch, whether that person that did not become ill did or did not eat the mushrooms… ""And of course, we're trying to ascertain what it is that has actually caused the poisoning to the four people that attended."" Erin has denied any wrongdoing and no charges are expected. She broke down in front of cameras outside her home on Monday and claimed she didn't do anything as cops investigate. When asked where the mushrooms came from, who picked them or what meal she made for her guests, Erin didn't answer. She said: ""I loved them and I'm devastated that they're gone. ""Gail was like the mum I didn't have because my mum passed away four years ago and Gail had never been anything but good and kind to me. ""Ian and Heather were some of the best people I'd ever met. They never did anything wrong to me."" She was later seen loading a suitcase into the boot of her car and leaving the property. Locals have been left stunned as news of the deaths emerged. Nathan Hersey, the mayor of South Gippsland, described the situation as ""shocking"". Fran Grimes, who works closely with Wilkinson, the minister, told The Age: ""I think it’s devastating. Dark things happen in this world."" All four victims suffered symptoms consistent with eating death cap mushrooms - including nausea and stomach pain. Just half of a death cap mushroom is sufficient to kill an adult.","https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668391-1.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668392-1.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668387-1.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668388.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668389-1.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668393-1.jpg",Ex of Erin Patterson who hosted deadly mushroom lunch that killed his parents ‘nearly died of mystery illness last year’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23396817/ex-erin-patterson-deadly-mushrooms-nearly-died-mystery/
"RUSSIAN ally Belarus has begun massive military exercises with missiles and tanks close to NATO's Achilles heel as Wagner Group forces have also reportedly been spotted at the border. The Suwalki Gap, spanning the Polish-Lithuania border, has seen an influx of troops as NATO nations strengthen their borders for fear of provocation from Russian-linked Belarus. Belarus said the current exercise will “train troops in controlling units during combat"", but is seen as a threat from President Lukashenko on the orders of Vladimir Putin . There is as yet no direct evidence of Wagner involvement in the exercises at Gozhsky training ground, but its soldiers have been seen close to the NATO border in recent weeks. It has been confirmed that the Wagner mercenaries are training Belarusians for armed conflict, as Belarus boasted about ""learning lessons from the war"" in which Wagner has fought. Poland said its seen an increase in attempts to illegally cross the border from Belarus, resulting in the deployment of a further 1,000 Polish troops this week. This 60-mile strip Suwalki Gap is wedged between Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad . It has massive strategic importance for NATO and the EU - as well as Russia - if conflict were to erupt. For the West, it is the only land link to the three ex-Soviet Baltic republics - Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia - which are seen as vulnerable to Putin if the current east-west tension worsens. For Russia, control of the corridor would give a land link to Kaliningrad, the main base of Putin’s Baltic Fleet. It comes shortly after Belarusian troops and the Wagner mercenary group announced they would conduct joint military exercises after the attempted coup from Wagner soldiers in late June. Last month, Russia threatened to use the Wagner group to invade NATO's weakest link in Poland and Lithuania , a move which would likely trigger World War 3 . A top Putin parliamentarian claimed on state television the mercenary group is prepared to strike in ""a matter of hours"" from Belarus . Russian reservist Col-Gen Andrey Kartapolov, also an MP and chairman of the Russian parliament’s defence committee, has said that Wagner forces could be deployed in this sensitive location. He threatened: “There is such a place as the Suwalki Corridor... Should anything happen, we need this Suwalki Corridor very much… “A strike force [based in Wagner forces in Belarus] is ready to take this corridor in a matter of hours.” A Russian move here with state-backed Wagner would likely trigger NATO’s clause 5, setting the Alliance against Russia. In late June, Wagner soldiers marched on Moscow in an attempted coup led by exiled Wagner commander Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin fled to Belarus after striking a deal with Vladimir Putin to stand down his rebel forces just 120 miles from Moscow. It was the largest challenge to Putin's iron fist rule since he rose to power in the aftermath of the collapsed Soviet Union and took control of the Kremlin more than two decades ago. After his expulsion from Russia, the whereabouts of Putin's former lap dog remained a mystery for weeks as thousands of Wagner troops have arrived in Belarus . An embarrassing image emerged of the warlord sitting on a camp bed in his pants after it was confirmed he had arrived in Belarus.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/military-drills-belarus-armed-forces-836795080.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TM-MAP-RUSSIA-MERCENARY-v3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/military-drills-belarus-armed-forces-836795073.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tanks-near-military-headquarters-rostov-827251278.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screen-grab-russian-yevgeny-prigozhin-827368676.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/russian-president-vladimir-putin-right-833667324.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mercenary-fighters-wagner-private-military-832987157.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/military-drills-belarus-armed-forces-836795078.jpg",Wagner troops on Nato’s doorstep at ‘weak link’  border as Belarussians launch missiles in chilling war games,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23394483/wagner-drills-poland-belarus-russia-ukraine-war-tension-nato/
"AN ITALIAN bar has added a bizarre extra charge to customers who want their sandwiches cut in half - and the owner has given his baffling reason behind it. The posh eatery at Italy's exclusive Lake Como sparked outrage after it revealed its new £1.70 slicing fee. One disgruntled customer shared a photograph of the Bar Pace receipt online as proof of the baffling charge. The printout clearly shows that the establishment had charged them £1.70 for the privilege of cutting their fancy sarnie in two. Listed as ""diviso da meta"" it translates into English as ""divided in half"". The total pushed the already pricy £6.46 ""toast vegetariano e patatine"" - or veggie toast and crisps - up to a whopping £8.20. Lake Como is known as one of the most exclusive destinations in the world and Hollywood star George Clooney has a mansion overlooking the shore. The owner of the bar, who has not been named, hit back in Italian media, saying that ""additional requests have a cost"". They explained: ""If a customer asks me to make two portions of toast, I have to use two saucers, two napkins and go to the table using two hands. ""It is true that the customer is always right, but it is equally true that additional requests have a cost."" The customer, also unnamed, was reportedly at the bar in Gera Lario, a small town located on the northern shore of Lake Como, with his partner. They ordered a fizzy drink, the sandwich to share, a water, and a coffee, for a total cost of £13.50. The TripAdvisor user said: ""This has never happened to me in any of the places I have visited in the world."" This comes after a restaurant in Brisbane , Australia, came under fire for charging 25 per cent more on a public holiday as well as a 7 per cent surcharge for splitting the bill.

"A BRIDE was walked down the aisle by her two dads - her biological father and the man who raised her after she was snatched as a toddler. Miche Zephany Sheldon, 26, was taken from her cot in Groote Schur Hospital, Cape Town , only three days after she was born. She was snatched by Lavona Solomon, who had been suffering from fertility issues and took the baby while disguised as a nurse. Solomon raised the child with her husband Michael, who was unaware of the situation. The girl, originally named Zephany Nurse and born on April 27, 1997, lived with the couple for 19 years, with no idea she was the biological daughter of another family. Until the day Cassidy joined Miche's school in 2015, and realised they looked exactly alike. Miche was then prompted to do a DNA test by social workers at the school. Results came in and the girl found out that Lavona and Michael were not her real parents, and that Cassidy was her biological sister. Solomon was arrested shortly afterwards and received a 10 year sentence for kidnapping Miche. She is now coming to the end of her sentence and is due to be released from Worcester Female Prison on August 18. Despite the shocking discovery, Miche - previously dubbed ""South Africa's Madeleine McCann "" - grew to love the family who raised her. Wanting to leave everything in the past, the bride asked both Michael and her biological dad, Morne Nurse, to walk her down the aisle. ""Michael had been my dad my whole life - he fathered me,"" she said. ""I'm so glad Morne opened his heart to walk alongside him down the aisle. ""It was such a beautiful day. We saw the unionship of my two families."" Miche was introduced to her birth parents on February 25, 2015, aged 17 - but didn't feel an instant connection to them. Now working as a financial bookkeeper, the 26-year-old no longer has any contact with Solomon but doesn't see her as a criminal. ""I don't see the mum who raised me as criminal and evil. Everyone just got hurt in the process. We all just needed to heal,"" she said.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/families-see-swns-story-swftkidnap-836575483.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/miche-zephany-sheldon-see-swns-836575549.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/miche-see-swns-story-swftkidnap-836637213.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/853c340b-9ce5-4716-b53e-3fb4fb4692d9.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/see-swns-story-swftkidnap-woman-836575511.jpg",‘South Africa’s Maddie’ snatched as toddler & raised by another man walks down the aisle with him AND her biological dad,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23395597/south-africa-maddie-mcann-snatched-toddler-wedding-two-dads/
"MICKEY Mouse might be going down under as Australia could soon get its own Disneyland park. Melbourne has been pencilled in as the potential Aussie home for the most magical place on earth. The coastal city's top official, Lord Mayor Sally Cap, has not only voiced her support for the plans but named an ideal site for the development. She said Melbourne is regaining its reputation as the country's tourism capital after the hard years of Covid and explained how a Down Under Disney would be exactly the right fit. “As Australia’s capital city of fun, of course we should have a Disney theme park in Melbourne. We’ve even got the perfect spot for it – Fishermans Bend,” she said. “We saw with the Firefly Zipline just how much Melburnians love a thrilling ride. ""At Fishermans Bend, exhilarating roller-coasters could soar over the Yarra as part of a Disneyland , Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom. “Melbourne also offers visitors the best tourism experience available in Victoria, from world-class hotels, unbeatable retail offerings and some of the best food and drink in Australia. “I know a Disney theme park in our municipality would be a huge hit with residents — myself included — visitors, students and traders.” However, a prime piece of land — north of Geelong and about 30 minutes from Melbourne's central business district — floated as a home for the world’s seventh Disneyland for years appears to be more achievable. The huge block of vacant land near Avalon Airport hasn’t been ruled out by the airport’s chairman either, Perth Now reported. David Fox, the son of billionaire trucking magnate Lindsey Fox, has confirmed an entertainment precinct is already earmarked for the site. Mr Fox has reportedly held meetings with Disney. “There’s an entertainment precinct that we’ve defined. I wouldn’t say (for a) Disneyland at this moment in time, but anything is possible,” he said in March. ""In regards to other parts of the precinct, we need to get the rail connectivity lined up."" Other cities such as Sydney , Adelaide and the Gold Coast have also attempted to lure Mickey and friends but were unsuccessful. A petition has been circulating online since 2020 demanding Disneyland come to Australia and has gained tens of thousands of signatures. Disney parks have already expanded out of the United States with locations established in Paris , Tokyo , and Hong Kong . If Melbourne gets the go-ahead, Australia will become Mickey's seventh home.","https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/mickey-mouse-front-sleeping-beauty-725704890.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/j1j6re-beautiful-aerial-panorama-yarra-836816765.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/a712f82b-6c2b-4894-b104-a40bcb37c8b7.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/3228540c-84ae-4de1-9674-1147ae04d4c9.jpg",Australia’s first Disneyland moves a step closer as ‘the perfect spot’ for theme park’s location is revealed,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23398560/australia-disneyland-location-revealed/
"WHEN your baking under the Spanish sun, there are few things that seem more attractive than diving into the sea to cool down. But beachgoers in Majorca now risk being slapped with an £800 (900 euros) fine if they jump into the Mediterranean , amid a number of serious incidents. Crowds flock to beaches in both Alcudia and Muro for their beauty, boat excursions and to lie on the sand while sinking into a good book. However, officials have been forced to step in over safety concerns as reckless swimmers are using the jetties as a makeshift diving board. Thrill seekers are throwing themselves into the water from the small pier where tourists pile on and off boats for various day trips. Although they are patrolled by workers from tour firms, they have been unable to stop people from leaping into the shallow water in the picture postcard resorts. Locals say holidaymakers and youngsters are often unaware of the lack of depth at the Bay of Alcudia and Playa de Muro. Both are famed for their calm, shallow waters - but adrenaline junkies are still hurling themselves off the jetties despite warning signs. At least two jumpers were hospitalised this summer - while countless others are said to have misjudged the dive and sustained injuries. Muro Police 's Deputy Inspector, Toni Carrió, has been working alongside excursion staff and lifeguards to warn people of the danger. He told the Majorca Daily Bulletin : "" Every year we have incidents with people jumping. You can't see how deep it is. ""People don't know that it's only half a metre. The incidents are usually minor, but this season we have had two serious ones. ""It's been years since there was anything as serious as now. ""It's worrying that some adults jump, especially if they are with their children."" With one leap you can change your life. The beach safety coordinator said they have now brought in a hefty fine in the hopes it discourages holidaymakers from diving in. ""Fines are considered to be a last resort,"" Toni said. ""The fine for jumping into the sea from the jetty is 900 euros, although no fine has been imposed up to now."" He explained that installing railings to deter jumpers would only give them a higher point to launch themselves from. Toni added: ""The easy thing would be to close the jetty, but that would mean people pay for the sinners. ""The company's workers and the lifeguards help us out and do a great job. The police will and do respond. ""But we ask people to be responsible. We can't be constantly watching. With one leap you can change your life.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bookthemout-campaign-encourage-tourists-visit-836833144.jpg,Holiday warning as tourists face massive £800 fines for JUMPING in the sea on Spanish beaches,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23398399/holiday-warning-massive-fine-jumping-in-sea-spain/
"PORN star Beshine brags that she has the biggest boobs in the world - but she says her XXX-sized bosoms have now taken on a mind of their own. The German adult actress, 40, says her colossal implants that are swelled with 10 litres worth of saline have become out of control. She explained the huge breasts that sit on her tiny 5ft 6in frame regularly leave a trail of destruction wherever she goes. Although she fiercely believes ""bigger is better"", Beshine admits her enormous knockers make simple everyday activities a struggle. The OnlyFans model, real name Mayra Hills , carries around the equivalent of two car tyres, a push lawn mower or a small toddler on her chest. Inevitably, her boobs are a force to be reckoned with - you can ask the two bottles of expensive fine wine that fell victim. Beshine wrote in her now-retired blog: ""My boobs stick out so much that I often knock over things. ""It seems like the sheer size of my boobs is sometimes out of my control and they have their own kind of mind. ""My boobs move a little bit slower now but when they start to move nothing can stop them and they will knock over mostly everything around me. ""This time they knocked over two bottles of precious wine."" However, they do occasionally come in handy to rest her snacks on when she's relaxing on her couch. The porn star also complained that her supersize bust has also landed her in trouble in the changing rooms. ""I already had several store owners who wanted money from me for the tops I tried on even if I didn’t want to buy them. ""They told me after I tried them on that they were baggy and worn out,"" Beshine, who now has to get her clothes custom-made, said. But the X-rated creator is still extremely proud of what she claims are the ""biggest boobs in the universe"". Extreme implants, such as Beshine's XXX-cups, come with serious health risks and do not last a lifetime. The model, one of Germany's most famous adult entertainers, will likely suffer from back pain and will have to undergo further surgery . Beshine has stayed out of the limelight in recent years, but it is believed that she still holds the record for the world's largest boobs. She also continues to run her own successful adult website, while thousands of fans also flock to OnlyFans to see her. We previously told how a woman whose boobs weigh a mighty 40lb each said they could keep growing.

"THE manager of Luna Park where a teenager was tragically killed has broken his silence with a major update. A 17-year-old, known only as Sammy, died at the theme park in Cap D’Agde, southern France , after suspected high winds rocked the ‘Adrenaline’ slingshot ride on Sunday. A 19-year-old woman was also injured when both fell 180ft and is in a critical condition in hospital after suffering multiple traumas. An investigation has been opened and four people, including the park's manager, were taken into custody for questioning. The park’s manager Pierrick Pubil told Midi Libre : “Since the start of my police custody, I have only thought of the families. “The little ones. It haunts me. The evil is there. It will mark me for life"" He added that he had never seen an accident on the Adrenaline ride previously. Pubil also announced that the ride would be permanently closed, “if only out of respect for the little ones”. He said that once the authorities allowed it, the ride would be dismantled. The manager added that he would pay for the funeral . He said: “We will do everything we need but it will never be enough. It is a pain that we will always have in our hearts.” Local prosecutor Raphael Balland said at the time: ""Two people were victims of an accident while using the Adrenaline attraction. ""An adolescent aged 17 died of his injuries and a young woman of 19 was taken to hospital at Montpellier as an absolute emergency (case)."" Balland said that the teenagers struck obstacles as they plunged from the cable swing ride, which is believed to reach speeds of 70mph. An investigation has been opened and four people, including the theme park manager, were taken into custody to be questioned by police. They have since been released as the investigation continues. Cap d'Adge mayor Gilles d'Ettore said that Saturday night had been very windy, which was ""very rare for Agde"". The ""Adrenaline"" attraction involves passengers strapping into harnesses and being winched 180ft into the air. They are then released to swing on the cable at high-speeds. Witnesses told local media sources that the cable had deviated from its usual path, which led to the riders allegedly hitting the metal pylon that holds the attraction up and then being ejected from their harnesses. The investigation is ongoing. Local news outlet, Midi Libre, reported that a man received stitches in hospital after grazing his head on the ground after riding on ""Adrenaline"" in 2019. In 2015 at the same park, a young couple were thrown from a slingshot ride when it snapped mid-air.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ec67bd62-2c2a-4667-988b-6f9c42fa2f8e.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teen-17-killed-theme-park-836573615-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teen-17-killed-theme-park-836573614-1.jpg",Major update after teen killed on 70mph ‘Adrenaline’ slingshot ride as theme park manager breaks silence,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23401139/luna-park-teen-boy-died-manager-update/
"THE hotel where ITV’s Benidorm is filmed is removing towels from deserted sunbeds — and creating some real-life drama. Staff launched a crackdown as guests queue for two hours each morning to bag spots by the pool . If they wander off, they risk having their stuff lobbed into lost property — sparking heated rows in the sun. Guest Guy Gibson, 46, from Newcastle , said trying to chill at Benidorm’s Sol Pelicanos Ocas was a “nightmare”. “All day long we’ve got to keep an eye on the beds and watch out for the ‘fun police’. ""Even if you’re in the pool they try to take your towels.” The Sun yesterday watched guests bring chairs to queue from 7am at the hotel, called The Solana in the show . A red tape was removed at the 9am opening, and tourists sprinted into the pool area to claim sunbeds . Most covered theirs with towels before heading off to breakfast. But staff soon slapped notices on empty loungers, warning guests “it is not allowed to reserve sunbeds with towels or other belongings”. They had an hour to return or their stuff would be “deposited at lost property”. The hardline tactic infuriated some holidaymakers — though a few agreed with it. Mum Jo Burnham, 43, from Portsmouth , said: “A man started shouting about it. ""People got really heated. I think it’s a good system. ""It means you don’t have to worry too much about finding a bed.” Sunbed wars have flared up across the Med, with some hotels employing security . Sol Pelicanos Ocas’ owner Melia Hotels International said it currently had 1,800 guests and only around 700 loungers. It added: “Although we understand that this measure is not satisfactory for all guests, it aims to improve the experience of our customers by offering better management of the sunbeds.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/people-sun-lounger-queue-morning-836779141.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cb3b19fe-2f57-4573-9a34-234773aa8a88.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/people-sun-lounger-queue-morning-836779148.jpg",Brit tourists furious as hotel where ITV’s Benidorm filmed cracks down on sunbed-hoggers,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23400808/brit-tourists-benidorm-sunbeds/
"A SPANISH shopkeeper allegedly launched a fake hunt to find the owner of a winning lottery ticket in a bid to claim the cash himself. Police claim Manuel Reija Gonzalez staged an elaborate plot with his lotto official brother to try and bag the £4.05million prize money. The ticket seller in the city of A Coruna was hailed as a local hero in June 2012 after launching a public appeal to find the customer who bought it from him. He told local news that he was on a mission to reunite the ticket with the rightful owner rather than keeping the windfall for himself. Manuel claimed that he had miraculously found the lotto slip during a clear out, but cops believe he tricked the buyer into handing it over. He had told reporters over a decade ago that he ""had to sit down"" and ""almost broke his chair"" after seeing the seven-figure sum pop up on the screen. But investigators have accused him of telling the unsuspecting Spainard that the £4million ticket was worth little over a euro. The shopkeeper then allegedly enlisted the help of his brother, who worked for the national lottery , to assist him in cashing in the ticket for himself, the Guardian reports. It is claimed that Manuel tried to scoop the jackpot on five separate occasions, but each attempt was refused by lottery authorities. Officials had also raised suspicions about the shopkeeper's bizarre versions of events and subsequently launched an investigation. After publicising the official search for the winner, a whopping 317 people from across Spain came forward to claim the ticket as theirs. But all of the claims were proved to be false. A judge then ordered police to take over the peculiar probe, as well as investigating Manuel for possible fraud. He has since been charged with the crime , while his brother was also slapped with money laundering charges. Both siblings, who deny the charges, face up to six years behind bars. Behind the scenes, cops had made significant progress in their search for the legitimate winner. Officers found that a lotto player in A Coruna had been using the same combination of numbers for a lengthy period of time. Tickets with the same digits were also purchased in Mallorca and on the Costa Del Sol, giving police a substantial lead. Chief Inspector José Manuel López said: ""We reached the conclusion that this was someone with plenty of free time who took the Christmas and Easter holidays somewhere warm, probably a pensioner."" Cops then called on the expertise of Imserso, a branch of the Spanish government which organises holidays for elderly people. They were then able to track down a woman whose movements corresponded with the ticket sales. It turned out to be the buyer's wife, who explained that her husband had passed away in 2014. Prosecutors allege that Manuel duped him by only awarding him a small prize when he was entitled to millions. They called for the prize money to be given to the widow and the daughter of the man who bought the lucky ticket. The officers have been awarded the police merit medal for their investigation into establishing the identity of the ticket holder.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lotto-con-bizarre-lottery-scam-836852648.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lotto-con-bizarre-lottery-scam-836852644.jpg",Bizarre lottery ‘scam’ saw shopkeeper ‘launch a FAKE hunt for owner of winning ticket – in bid to keep £4m for himself’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23401082/shopkeepers-fake-hunt-owner-winning-lottery-ticket-scam-spain/
"SEVEN people died and 88 were wounded in a Russian double tap missile strike on a hotel and restaurant in eastern Ukraine. The deadly blasts struck 40 minutes apart injuring dozens of first responders who raced to pull survivors from the rubble.

"A MUM who was arrested over a plot to pay a hitman to murder her husband has broken her silence. Former beauty queen Lindsay Shiver, 36, was booked after the alleged murder plot was accidentally foiled by police in the Bahamas. Lindsay, from Georgia , US, became estranged from her husband Robert Shiver after falling for local man Terrance Bethel Robert, an insurance exec and former Auburn University football player, is said to have discovered the affair and filed for divorce . He then became the target of the plan to murder him, it is alleged. Lindsay and alleged lover Bethel, 28, were arrested along with local man Faron Newbold, who cops claim was hired for the job. The three suspects are currently being held in custody in Bahamas capital Nassau. Today Shiver pleaded her innocence as she was seen for the first time since her arrest. She shook her head and mouthed the word “no” when asked by journalists if she was guilty, reports MailOnline . Wearing flip flops, ripped blue jeans and a tight white V-neck she was seen entering Nassau Police Station ahead of her bail hearing on Wednesday. Previously Bahamas Court News said cops stumbled upon the murder scheme by chance while investigating a different case. In early July, they were looking through a phone of suspect in a burglary at a local bar in Great Guana Cay to gather evidence. Cops reportedly unearthed incriminating text messages detailing the alleged hitman plot. The chance discovery of the texts foiled the plan before it could be put into action, it is claimed. The three suspects are currently being held in custody in Bahamas capital Nassau. They appeared in court on Friday but were not required to enter pleas, and are due back in court on October 5. Robert and Lindsay, who have three children, owned a house in the Bahamas, a source told Thomasville Times-Enterprise. According to Lindsay’s Instagram account, she first met Robert during a fitness class at Auburn University in 2007. One of her posts in 2020 read: ""So thankful for that fitness class 13 years ago that brought us together and all of the love, laughter, and life we have created ever since! I love you babe.

"ELEVEN people have been killed after a huge fire erupted at a holiday home for the disabled as they slept. Emergency crews rushed to the scene as flames engulfed the cottage in the eastern town of Wintzenheim in France early on Wednesday. Emergency crews rescued 17 people from the burning building but 11 adults - one guide and ten guests - were unable to escape. The bodies of those missing have since been found in the rubble. Local authorities said the horror blaze broke out at about 6.30am local time (4.30am BST) and was “very violent”. It swept through the building before being brought under control by 76 firefighters. Hauwiller said only those who were staying on the ground floor of the private accommodation were able to escape the raging flames. But the 11 remaining occupants were trapped on the upper floor and in a mezzanine area that collapsed, according to Hauwiller. Police said 17 people were evacuated from the property - including one rushed to hospital with serious injuries. A group of people from the city of Nancy, a two-hour drive away, were staying in the cottage. The fire broke out so early that ""people were caught in their sleep,"" Wintzenheim deputy mayor Daniel Leroy told BFM TV. He said those missing were likely to have been aged between 25 and 50. Shocking pictures show firefighters working at the burnt-out cottage. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said she was headed to the site, adding on social media: ""My thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones."" Mathieu Klein, the mayor of Nancy, said: ""Deeply bruised by the terrible fire this morning in Wintzenheim of a lodging which welcomed people with disabilities from Nancy. ""I send my greatest support and my thoughts to the families of the victims."" A spokesman for the fire and rescue service said the blaze was ""quickly brought under control despite the violent flames"". The cause of the fire is being investigated.

"A MASSIVE mushroom cloud erupted near Moscow after a suspected drone attack on a tech plant where Putin's stealth bombers are reportedly stashed. At least one person was killed in the explosion at the Zagorski plant that sent flames and smoke billowing hundreds of feet into the sky. The blast close to Russia 's capital, which has left at least six people missing, blew out windows in nearby apartments. Natalia Nikitina, 45, died in hospital after suffering horrific burns when the plant in Sergiyev Posad erupted. A driver for the company that rented the building, Piro-Ross, remains missing under the rubble. The plant is closely involved in the development of Russia’s new generation stealth bomber, independent Russian media outlet Agentstvo reported. Russia's government public procurement website indicates the firm supplies optics to Putin's security forces. It seems that the company have been articipating in the development of the tyrant's new-generation strategic missile-carrying bomber, a project known as Messenger, since 2019. The report said: ""State contracts of the plant ceased to be published almost immediately after the start of the war - from March 2022. ""But the contracts concluded earlier are still available. ""Among them - ‘implementation of an integral part of the development work on the topic code: Messenger-1OEP / L'. ""The term of the contract is 2027, the cost of the work is 69 million roubles” - £560,000 at current prices after a collapse in the value of Russian currency caused by Putin's war."" Extraordinary pictures show the towering pillar of smoke and fire after the mega blast at the plant in Sergiyev Posad. Witnesses reported a ""whistle, flash and a roar"" as the blast rocked the factory in Moscow region. Early reports that pinned the explosion on a drone attack were later denied by Russian officials - but people in the area reported seeing something flying towards the building. However, local officials instead blamed the explosion on an industrial accident at the plant. At least 49 people are reported to have been injured and witnesses said the plant - used to make optics for missiles, jets, night vision goggles and rifle scopes - is ""in ruins"". Six people are in a serious condition, Mash media reported. And it's feared up to five people may be buried under the rubble, Moscow region governor Andrey Vorobyov said. It's understood the blast happened in a warehouse containing pyrotechnic equipment. Deaths are feared as first responders are desperately digging beneath the rubble. Pictures showed nearby streets strewn with debris hurled out from the enormous blast. And locals reported being thrown backwards by the force of the explosion. The exact cause of the explosion has not been officially confirmed - but it came after Russia was once again menaced by Ukrainian kamikaze drones last night, with two reportedly shot down overnight in nearby Moscow. Witnesses have reported a truck exploding at the site - which also produces explosives and pyrotechnics used by Russia. Others said they had heard a strange ""whistling"" sound before the enormous blast rocked the town. Windows have been blown out from nearby houses and an evacuation has been issued as the 17,000-square-foot site continues to burn. Another local report said the whole town was ordered to evacuate. Sabotage attacks along with mysterious explosions and fires have been reported across Russia since Vladimir Putin 's vile invasion of Ukraine last February. A worker at the plant suggested it was attacked by a drone. “Something flew in,” the anonymous source told VChK-OGPU Telegram channel. “First a whistle, then the light blinked and an explosion. There was 'a vacuum, a flash and a roar'. “They had magnesium and gunpowder there.” Another witness said: ""It’s terrible, the whole plant is destroyed. I'm shocked. “Imagine, we were just thrown back [by the blast] in the welding section. It's just awful.” Two shells were found among the debris - but it is unclear if they were linked to the explosion. The main plant produces night sights for Russian tanks and other hi-tech military items. But explosives were on part of the territory leased to PiroRos company, which also had dealings with the defence Ministry. Baza media said that state investigators were examining “sabotage” as a possible cause of the giant blast. The plant itself is one of the main developers and manufacturers of a wide range of observation devices, medical equipment for diagnosing and treating diseases of eye tissues and vessels, fluorographs and X-ray image intensifiers, as well as various photometric devices. It is a leading enterprise for the development and serial production of binoculars and monoculars, and is believed to have links to the defence ministry in Russia. Russian official Sergei Pakhomov said: “The source of the detonation was a pyrotechnics warehouse, the premises for which were rented by one of the well-known companies in the city. “The cause of the explosion is in violation of technological processes.” Baza reported that the director of the Piro-Ross denied an explosion in his pyrotechnic warehouse.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mushroom-cloud-looms-near-moscow-836962748-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/view-shows-ambulances-near-zagorsk-836957345.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Explosion-aftermath-4-East2west-News.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/9372e1af-87c5-4bb5-9925-443be656e03a.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fe15ade7-c642-4163-8b9a-c5b893ad398f.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Moscow-region-explosion-9-East2west-News.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sergiyev-Posad-plant-explosions-shell-1-east2west-news.jpg",‘Drone attack’ on stealth bomber tech plant leaves at least one dead as huge mushroom cloud looms over Moscow,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23404286/massive-explosion-russian-defence-plant/
"THE ex-husband of a mum who allegedly served a poisonous mushroom lunch reportedly pulled out of the fatal meal at the last minute. Erin Patterson, 48, invited Gail and Don Patterson, her former in-laws, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson and her husband Ian to her home in Leongatha, Australia. After eating the meal - which allegedly included poisonous mushrooms - the guests became violently ill and Gail, 70, Heather, 66, and Don, 70, later died. Ian, a pastor, remains in hospital in a critical condition, awaiting a liver transplant. Homicide detectives have confirmed Erin is a suspect in the case. Officers have seized a number of items - including a food dehydrator from a tip, believed to have been used to prepare the mushrooms. And sources have now revealed Erin invited her estranged husband Simon Patterson to join his parents for lunch at their former family home. But he reportedly pulled out of the get-together at the last minute. A friend of Simon told Daily Mail Australia : ""Simon was supposed to go to the lunch but couldn't make it at the last minute."" A neighbour of Gail and Don said Simon had lived with his parents after splitting from Erin - but moved out late last year. It's understood he had remained amicable with Erin. ""He was a pretty good sort of a person who wouldn't hold those grudges,"" the neighbour said. ""I don't know the reason they were there, but probably to see their grandkids."" It comes after Simon revealed that he almost died in May last year from a mystery illness. He said he collapsed at home and was placed into an induced coma. In a social media post, Simon wrote: ""I collapsed at home, then was in an induced coma for 16 days through which I had three emergency operations mainly on my small intestine, plus an additional planned operation. ""My family were asked to come and say goodbye to me twice, as I was not expected to live. ""I was in intensive care for 21 days..."" It’s believed Simon coached U16 boys basketball at Poowong. In the post, he thanked his wife, Erin, and their two children for their support. Homicide detectives searched Erin's house on Saturday and quizzed her on the deaths. She was later released. Investigators are still unsure whether she also ate the meal - but cops confirmed a different lunch was served to her two children. It's understood cops are seeking to review CCTV footage from the tip where the food dehydrator was found to see which vehicles entered the site. A police source told The Age that cops are conducting forensic tests on the dehydrator in the hope it could hold key clues to finding out what happened. Victoria Police Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said: ""We have to keep an open mind in relation to this, that it could be very innocent but again we just don't know at this point."" ""We will be working closely with medical experts, toxicologists… in the hope we can understand exactly what has gone on and provide some answers to the family,"" Thomas added. ""We're trying to understand who ate what at the lunch, whether that person that did not become ill did or did not eat the mushrooms… ""And of course, we're trying to ascertain what it is that has actually caused the poisoning to the four people that attended."" Erin has denied any wrongdoing and no charges are expected. She broke down in front of cameras outside her home on Monday and claimed she didn't do anything as cops investigate. When asked where the mushrooms came from, who picked them or what meal she made for her guests, Erin didn't answer. She said: ""I loved them and I'm devastated that they're gone. ""Gail was like the mum I didn't have because my mum passed away four years ago and Gail had never been anything but good and kind to me. ""Ian and Heather were some of the best people I'd ever met. They never did anything wrong to me."" She was later seen loading a suitcase into the boot of her car and leaving the property. Locals have been left stunned as news of the deaths emerged. Nathan Hersey, the mayor of South Gippsland, described the situation as ""shocking"". Fran Grimes, who works closely with Wilkinson, the minister, told The Age: ""I think it’s devastating. Dark things happen in this world."" All four victims suffered symptoms consistent with eating death cap mushrooms - including nausea and stomach pain. Just half of a death cap mushroom is sufficient to kill an adult.","https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836955570.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/SIMON-MUSHROOM.png,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/image.jpeg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/image-3.jpeg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/image-4.jpeg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/image-2.jpeg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/woman-cooked-poisonous-mushroom-lunch-836668393-2.jpg",Twist in killer mushroom case as suspect Erin Patterson’s ex ‘PULLED OUT of deadly meal’ that killed three relatives,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23405048/twist-killer-mushroom-case-ex-pulled-out-deadly-meal/
"A MODEL claims she was stopped from boarding a flight because of her skimpy cosplay outfit. Influencer Kine-Chan, 21, shared images of herself walking through Navegantes Airport in Brazil dressed in just a black bikini, turquoise wig and sandals. But she claims security guards barred her from flying as she was dressed in next to nothing. Kine-Chan, who runs an OnlyFans page, claims she put on the outfit before flying to save time but was ordered to change before she could fly. She said she was going to an event dressed as the fictional character Rebecca from the anime series Cyberpink. Kine-Chan told her 612,000 followers on Instagram : ""Xuxus, a very annoying situation happened this weekend!” “I tried to board at Navegantes airport dressed as Rebecca's Cosplay for an event. “I already knew that I could be late, so I was dressed so as not to waste time and could go straight to my room. “But I was told to go home and change clothes because the one I was wearing was not 'appropriate'. “I explained that I was going to an event. Anyway Rebecca barred lol.” It's unclear whether the outfit saga was a stunt, however. But when she shared her tale with her fans on social media , many told her she had gone too far. One wrote: ""Kine I love you but for the love of God, you could have put on an easy pull-up outfit, like a falling dress or even a button-down blouse."" Another added: ""They were right, you could have put clothes on there."" A third said:  ""AMG, it didn’t hurt to wear a dressing gown on top."" The Sun has contacted Navegantes Airport for comment.

"A GIRL lost a pint of blood in a horrifying water slide accident after staff allegedly failed to tell her a key safety rule. The eight-year-old's mum is suing for more than £500,000 after the shocking incident at Dreamworld’s WhiteWater World in Australia . The young girl and her siblings went on the Fully 6 slides at the Gold Coast park on November 22, 2020. As the youngster went down, her legs became uncrossed due to the ""forceful impact"" of the water, according to the claim seen by 7News . It is claimed she suffered significant internal injuries as a result - leaving her bleeding for two weeks and needing surgery. Her mum claimed they could not immediately find a lifeguard to help as the girl got off the slide - and the youngster lost an estimated 500ml of blood. It is claimed that she needed towels between her legs to attempt to stop her ""bleeding profusely"". The eight-year-old faced abdominal pain, anxiety and nightmares - and now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder , the claim states. The mum has filed the claim against Dreamworld’s parent company Ardent Leisure and contractor Swimplex Aquatics. She has accused Ardent staff of failing to tell the girl that she needed to keep her legs crossed during the entire descent down the slide. Bree Smith, from Shine Lawyers, said: ""This was an incredibly traumatic injury for somebody to suffer at any age, let alone a girl who’s just eight years old."" She added: ""We’re alleging that park staff failed to properly educate [her] on how to go down the ride safely, and that if a risk assessment had been done they would’ve identified the potential for injury. ""Our evidence is that there were no lifeguards in the splash down who responded to the injury area at the time and that it was up to (the girl’s) mum to get her help for what was plainly a serious injury. ""As a result of the serious injury to her daughter and the ongoing trauma, and having to find help for her daughter on her own, Sarah has been diagnosed with PTSD and has chronic post-traumatic anxiety symptoms. ""This incident has had a profound impact on the family, and it’s likely it will take a great deal of time yet for them to recover."" At the time, a WhiteWater World spokeswomen said the theme park “acknowledges the injury sustained by the guest in question”. The park explained that the girl had gone to the site's first aid room. They said she was tended to by a paramedic and a registered nurse, before being taken by ambulance to hospital . Four people on the Thunder River Rapids ride at the same theme park in October 2016. Sydney mum Cindy Low, 42, died along with Kate Goodchild – a 32-year-old woman from near Canberra – Kate's brother Luke Dorsett, and his partner Roozi Araghi. Ardent was fined £2million after pleading guilty to three charges relating to the deaths. After the four fatalities, Coroner James McDougall found a ""systemic failure by DreamWorld in relation to all aspects of safety"". At the time, Ardent said Dreamworld had taken steps to improve safety at the park as a result.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dreamworld-australia-fully-6-836958733.jpg,"Warning as girl, 8, loses a pint of blood going down water slide after staff ‘didn’t tell her key safety rule’",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23403702/warning-girl-loses-pint-blood-water-slide/
"A BRITISH doctor was killed by a single gunshot to the head in Cape Town after taking a wrong turn from the airport and driving into a riot. The 40-year-old man was with family members - including a baby - when he was gunned down in Nyanga, a township near Cape Town International Airport. Street clashes sparked by a week-long taxi drivers strike had erupted in the area and the Brit is understood to have been killed when he stopped his car. Three passengers in the car - including a small child - witnessed the horror and were taken to hospital for treatment for severe trauma. A police spokesman said: ""The deceased was seated in the driver seat with a gunshot wound to the head. ""Two passengers in shock and an infant were transported to a local hospital for medical treatment."" Lirandzu Themba, the spokeswoman for the police minister, said: ""The 40-year-old doctor was driving with two other persons in the vehicle. ""From the airport he apparently took a wrong turn off on Thursday evening and headed towards Nyanga. ""In Ntlangano Crescent a number of suspects approached his vehicle, shot and killed him. No arrests yet."" A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed it was supporting the man's family and speaking to local authorities. He was understood to be a British-Chinese national. The Brit is among five people who have been killed in the last week after a taxi driver strike turned violent. Negotiations between taxi unions and the government broke down on Monday - leading to strike action by the South African National Taxi Council. At least 120 people have been arrested in the violence. The Foreign Office issued a warning to Brits travelling to South Africa on Wednesday - urging travellers to stick to major routes and avoid the riots. ""There are currently minicab taxi strikes in the Cape Town area,"" it said. ""These strikes have the potential to turn violent and may impact multiple areas including journeys to and from the airport. ""Check for any disruption on your route before travelling, avoid violent protests and try to stick to major routes."" Protests erupted after a law was introduced giving the authorities the power to impound taxi driver's vehicles for driving without a licence, or registration plates. Cops started impounding vehicles last week - sparking violence as protesters torched buses and cars and pelted the police with stones. The office of the City of Cape Town said the riots had hit commuters leaving people stranded due to attacks on public transport. Police minister Bheki Cele said: ""The investigations into the five murders, attempted murders, public violence, arson, armed robberies, carjacking and malicious damage to property continue."" Cape Town city mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said: ""In Cape Town, violence will never be tolerated as a negotiating tactic."" Nyanga is one of the most dangerous places in South Africa.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/protesters-masiphumelele-clash-cape-towns-836877169.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/residents-masiphumelele-set-burning-barricades-836788628.jpg",Brit driver shot in head in front of terrified family including BABY after taking wrong turn from South African airport,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23409228/brit-doctor-shot-dead-wrong-turn-south-africa/
"A SAILOR was left fearing for his life after a pod of killer whales tore off the rudder on his yacht in a terrifying 45-minute rampage. Phep Philouceros, 70, was sailing off the coast of Cape Vincent in Portugal when the five orcas starting circling his 30ft vessel. He was forced to broadcast a Mayday distress alert during the sail to Royan, France . But Phep managed to capture the moment two of the beasts ripped off huge parts of his yacht - called Oxygene. He said the two orcas made light work of the rudder - shredding it in just ""one minute"". The sailor said he also heard the hull crack - but luckily he didn't spot any water gushing in. The shocking attack lasted for 45 minutes - and the orcas continued stalking the yacht even as it was being towed away by a rescue vessel. Phep, who has been sailing the seas for 55 years, said he has never experienced anything like it. He said: ""I think there were young orcas. They were about six or seven meters long. ""They were neither adults or babies. ""The attack wasn't too violent. The boat moved, it rotated but didn't capsize. ""If the orcas really wanted to sink the boat, they could have done it easily. I don't think it was their intention."" Phep's boat is now safely ashore in Sagres waiting to be repaired. Orcas have been ""deliberately"" swarming ships and slamming into them, in a campaign of terror that is believed to be led by a female orca named White Gladis . She has supposedly been heading a witch-hunt against boats and teaching her young apprentices how to attack and sink them. Scientists fear a ""critical moment of agony"" such as a collision may have sparked her aggression, and speculate she may now be spurring fellow killer whales on to target vessels . These attacks, which range from orcas simply approaching boats to actively interfering with them, are said to have begun in 2020 around the Strait of Gibraltar . Cape Vincent is just up the coast from the waters of Gibraltar. In a study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science in June last year, it was found that these orca assaults are directly aimed at sailing boats. The whales have been found to all follow a pattern of approaching from the stern of the vessel and striking the rudder. In May, sailors around Gibraltar were warned about the attacks - with no signs of them stopping. Orcas are well known for being sociable creatures and can therefore learn easily from one another - including tactics to take down sailors. Other scientists have suggested the attacks may be due to the highly intelligent orcas becoming territorial or simply wanting to play.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/orca-seen-beside-boat-see-836930173.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ORCA-2.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ORCA-1.png",I was attacked by a pod of killer whales who ripped rudder off my yacht – they didn’t stop even as vessel was towed away,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23408516/attacked-pod-killer-orcas-ripped-rudder-off-boat/
"A HAWK dropped its snake prey on a woman mowing her lawn - and she endured a bizarre billion-to-one ordeal as both creatures attacked her. Peggy Jones, 64, was in her garden in Silsbee, Texas , when the four-and-a-half foot snake suddenly fell onto her arm and began striking at her arm and face. The hawk - which had dropped the serpent onto her after grabbing it - swooped down to retrieve it and sank its talons deep into Peggy’s flesh as she battled the pair of predators. Peggy told last night how she feared she could die but escaped with puncture wounds and cuts and bruising to her arm and face. She said: ""As I was trying to sling my arm and sling the snake off, the snake wrapped around my arm. “I was violently shaking my arm to try and get the snake off. He just wrapped and squeezed tighter and tighter. ""The snake was striking in my face, it struck my glasses a couple of times. ""Then the hawk appeared just as fast as the snake had. ""It grabbed the snake and pulled it like he was going to carry it away and when he did, it flung my arm up. “The hawk was carrying my arm and the snake with it. “I’m screaming during this whole time, ‘Help me, Jesus! Please, help me, Jesus!’” Peggy said the hawk retreated and returned to its prey four times, slapping her in the face with its wings before managing to prise its prey free and fly off. Her husband Wendell dashed to her aid on his sit-and-ride mower and found her fleeing in a zigzag pattern clutching her bloodied arm as the struggling serpent was taken. Peggy - whose glasses were broken by the snake - was found not to have been bitten by the creature by hospital medics who bandaged her arm and prescribed antibiotics. She added: “I feel it was by the grace of God I am still alive and able to tell my story.” This comes after a man was bitten on his head by Britain's only deadly species of snake after it slithered into his tent on a camping holiday. Tony Mohammed believed the venomous adder sunk its fangs into his scalp as he slept.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gran-feared-going-die-attacked-836930931.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/happened-next-bizarre-silsbee-woman-836704385.jpg",A hawk dropped a snake on me as I cut my grass before BOTH beasts attacked me – I thought I was going to die,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23409214/hawk-dropped-snake-on-me-both-beasts-attacked/
"WITH racy dance shows, boozed-up Brits and the sickly sweet smell of cannabis filling the air, this European holiday hotspot might sound a little familiar. But it is not the infamous red light district of Amsterdam , where millions of tourists flock each year for legal joints and X-rated thrills. Rather, it is the sun-soaked streets of Malta , which has become a trendy new choice for young holidaymakers seeking ""good food, cheap booze and legal weed"". In 2021, the picturesque island - situated between Sicily and the North African coast - became the first EU country to legalise the cultivation and personal use of cannabis. The landmark ruling has led to dedicated drug shops popping up alongside the countless nightclubs in Paceville - a party district with rowdy nightlife to rival Magaluf . Just a few hundred metres from the strip , where twenty-somethings party hard into the early hours, is a booze and cigarette shop that sells pre-rolled joints. “I just sold my last one to two British girls,” the cashier tells us when we ask about the empty display. “It’s mainly tourists that buy this. Most of the locals just grow their own at home."" However, he added: “It does concern me how many tourists are smoking this at night and then driving the next day. If they get caught, the penalties can be bad.” Malta, a former favourite of families and the elderly, has emerged in recent years as the Med’s new Party Central. Young Brits are flocking here on the three-hour flights from London to take advantage of some of the lowest prices in Europe and drinking games organised by party groups. Bookings from the UK have increased more than threefold in the past two years, with a 366 per cent hike between June and September last summer. It comes as tourist favourites like Amsterdam - popular for its cannabis-friendly 'coffee shops' - try to overhaul their image by cracking down on boozing Brits . In May, the Dutch capital launched new measures making it illegal to smoke cannabis in its infamous red light district, while also ordering sex workers to close venues at 3am. As a result, Brits flocking to Malta for its new wave of superclubs and wild drinking games are also making the most of its groundbreaking new drug rules. While laws stipulate it should only be smoked inside, we saw many people on the beachfront of St Julien’s and Sliema openly flouting them. Most were tourists. One lad from Manchester who didn’t want to give his name said: “We knew it was legal here. It was one of the reason we chose Malta for a lads' holiday. “Good food, cheap booze and legal weed. It was a no brainer.” Another said: “It makes sure we relax while on holiday. It’s great.” One tells The Sun: “I hadn't realised it was legal here, but it's a good surprise. I've made the most of it.” With a strong police presence on the streets, however, breaking the law is ill-advised. Just this week, a 31-year-old man was seized by cops on Triq Santu Wistin after he was found with 30 bags of containing suspected cocaine and cannabis. The legalisation of cannabis led to fierce debate in the Catholic country, which only legalised divorce in 2011, and same-sex marriage and adoption in 2017. Owen Bonnici, who was the equality minister at the time of the vote in December 2021, said the ""historic"" move would help to ""curb drug trafficking by making sure that [users] now have a safe and regularised way from where they can obtain cannabis"". Desiree Attard, a lawyer who worked on drafting the law, told The Times: “We wanted to avoid the commercialisation seen in the US . ""We were inspired by the cannabis social clubs in Spain , and we went for decriminalisation rather than the tolerance they have in Holland.” SMOKING cannabis every day increases the risk of heart disease disease, a study earlier this year claimed. Heavy users of the Class B drug boosted the chances of developing the deadly condition by more than a third, compared to people who never smoke it. Researchers at Stanford University tracked medical records of more than 175,000 adults in the US and cross-referenced them with surveys about marijuana use. Previous studies have also linked regular usage with an increased risk of depression and suicidal thoughts. The drug has become easier to get hold of thanks to the opening of shops like the Cannabis Store Amsterdam in St Julien's and local off-licences selling joints. A worker at the Cannabis Store told us: “Almost everyone who comes in here to buy weed are British. “Some have picked Malta because they know it’s legal. Others are just happily surprised to find out it’s legal after arriving here to party.” The store-front is decorated with cannabis leaf paintings, and inside a range of drug paraphernalia is on display alongside different CBD products from skin-care to tea. The buds are kept under lock and key at the front counter and sold in batches of one gram. The legal limit per person is seven grams. For one gram of cannabis, it costs €19.99, the equivalent of £15.68. It is almost double the price many weed smokers pay in the UK to buy the leaves illegally. In Canada , which has also legalised the drug, it cost just £3.50 per gram. Almost everyone who comes in here to buy weed are British Under the law in Malta, people can possess up to seven grams, grow four plants and only smoke their joints at home. Violating these rules can result in hefty fines. Smoking cannabis in public will result in appearing before a justice commissioner and a fine of up to €235. Smoking in front of a minor can see the fine increase to a maximum of €500. Anyone caught possessing more than 28 grams can be charged between €50 and a maximum of €100, but will not result in a criminal record. Despite the strict rules, across the island the smell of weed wafts down beaches, through bars and even in the giant open air club Gianpaula near Rabat. Since many other drinking destinations in Europe started turfing out Brits for their bad behaviour, many have flocked to sunny Malta for the nightlife . The main strip in St Julians swarms with revellers from all nationalities, with Brits branded “the best behaved” by local cops. Bars on the next street over sell platters of up to 400 shots and pints of vodka for around a fiver. A spokesperson for the Malta tourist board previously told us: ""Malta is a popular holiday destination with the British market due to its ease of flight access from a number of regional airports across the UK and the value for money it offers. ""Whilst we do welcome those keen to experience our nightlife scene in the St Julian’s area, these travellers represents a very small number compared to those seeking to experience our rich culture, history and Maltese hospitality as evidenced by how many visit cultural attractions in Valletta, Mdina, Rabat and across Malta’s 95 square miles and our islands Gozo and Comino.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/malta-new-party-destination-parties-832239420.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/main-strip-paceville-clubs-malta-832238099-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/thea-names-many-depending-ones-832236882.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/JW-MALTA-PIC-FACES-BLURRED-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/love-around-bums-malta-new-832239351-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/malta-new-party-destination-parties-832238157-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/malta-new-party-destination-parties-832239412.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/malta-new-party-destination-parties-832238377-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/thea-jacobs-visits-legal-cannibis-836798125.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/malta-new-party-destination-parties-832239411.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/thea-names-many-depending-ones-832236902.jpg","How sunny European holiday island became Amsterdam-on-Sea as young Brits snap up ‘good food, cheap booze and legal weed’",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23378887/malta-holiday-nightclubs-cannabis-laws-alcohol-beaches/
"A RAGING inferno loomed over sun-loungers in Portugal as wildfires continue to spread through tourist hotspots. More than 1,000 locals and holidaymakers have been evacuated as hundreds of firefighters battle the flames. Thousands of hectares of forest in southern Portugal have been razed by the huge blaze - which has now swept across to Algarve resorts. Wildfires broke out on Saturday - but weather conditions hampered the efforts of emergency services. Around 1,400 people had to be evacuated from the Algarve, one of Portugal's top tourist destinations . A dramatic image from neighbouring Alentejo region shows giant plumes of black smoke filling the sky above a row of vacant sunloungers by a pool. The hotel was later gutted by a wildfire - with the destruction of Teima Alentejo SW in shocking pictures. Luisa Botelho and her ex-husband Paulo Camacho turned it into an award-winning country hotel after buying the property nearly ten years ago. Most of the main house is understood to have been destroyed by flames on Saturday. The chic B&B was voted the best rural hotel in Portugal in 2017 and received the TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Award in 2021. Revealing the damage the wildfire had caused, Luisa said: “Teima has been consumed by flames. This special place to which we dedicated all our lives now has a deep wound. “We will be closed until this wound heals, until we are once again able to welcome our customers and friends as we always have. “We will need everyone’s help so that we can shine again. We will provide updates soon.” Overnight reports said six wildfires are still raging in Portugal. It comes weeks after wildfires swept across Greek holiday islands Rhodes - forcing more than 20,000 holidaymakers and locals to flee The flames burned for nearly a week as Greece was battered by a spell of extreme heat that made it challenging to contain the blaze. But Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis insisted the island is now ""back to normal"". Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. And despite the heat this summer, Europe's record temperature of 48.8C - recorded in 2021 in Sicily - has not been reached and is currently not forecast to be broken.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/one-portugal-s-top-rural-836946031.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/one-portugal-s-top-rural-836945932.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/one-portugal-s-top-rural-836946056.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-fire-broke-baiona-area-836663014-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2023-hundreds-firefighters-fighting-today-836920213.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EPA_Portugal-Forest-Fire-Odemira_10789285jpg-JS836662984.jpg",Portugal wildfires: Inferno looms over SUN-LOUNGERS as wall of flames spreads to Algarve resorts and tourists evacuated,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23410605/portugal-wildfires-inferno-sun-loungers/
"A WOMAN has been left outraged after she was sacked over being late on 96 per cent of days while working from home. Suzie Cheikho, 38, had been working for Insurance Australia Group for 18 years before she was let go for ""not typing enough"". The work-from-home employee got the sack after her boss tracked her computer using special keystroke software. Suzie said she was left ""shocked and confused"" even though ironically, her own remote working performance had fallen short after missing deadlines and meetings, according to The Fair Work Commission (FWC). The former consultant had been on an improvement plan after concerns were raised about her performance and she had been responsible for monitoring ""work-from-home compliance"". During the review of her performance, after she was placed on the plan in November last year, her company used tracking software to count how many keystrokes she had been making during the day. When they saw that the numbers weren't reaching their expectations in February, they gave her the boot. She reportedly admitted to colleagues: ""Sometimes the workload is a bit slow, but I have never not worked. “I mean, I may go to the shops from time to time, but that is not for the entire day. I need to take some time to consider this and I will put forward a response."" Suzie's review lasted 49 days between October and December, News AU reported . The shocking results found that she did not work her rostered hours for 44 days, started her shift late on 47 days, finished early on 29 days, and carried out zero hours of work on four days. On the days Suzie did decide to log on, she had “very low keystroke activity” and recorded zero strokes over 117 hours in October, a whopping 143 hours in November, and 60 hours in December. She averaged 54 strokes per hour over the duration of her review, which showed “she was not presenting for work and performing work as required”. But the woman disputed the claims in a formal meeting following her surveillance and said she sometimes used other devices to log in when she had ""system issues"" on her laptop. However, the FWC found that when Suzie had a performance meeting with her manager on Teams,  she had ""F***” scrawled across her hand. She explained that she had a ""few things going on"" due to an injury and said: ""I have been going through a lot of personal issues which has caused a decline to my mental health and unfortunately I believe it has affected my performance and my work.” FWC Deputy President Thomas Roberts concluded that the evidence showed Suzie“was not working as she was required to do during her designated working hours” while monitored. He found Suzie could not provide a credible explanation for the data to her employers or throughout the FWC proceedings. He added: “The applicant was dismissed for a valid reason of misconduct, I have little doubt that the factors underlying the applicant’s disconnection from work were serious and real.""",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/woman-outraged-s-sacked-late-836978852.jpg,Woman outraged as she’s sacked over being late on 96% of days while working from home…after company snoops on her typing,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23409795/woman-sacked-late-working-from-home/
"A MAN has fallen to his death from a balcony while on a secret late night date with his girlfriend. Shaoib, 20, had come over for some pizza with his lover when they heard her father coming up the steps into the Hyderabad building. The man then ran to the edge of the terrace and fell off while trying to take support from some dangling wires, cops have said. Shaoib sustained severe injuries to his head after falling from the fourth floor apartment and was rushed to the city's Osmania General Hospital. The fall happened at 3am on Sunday and the 20-year-old was declared dead around 5.30am later that morning.

"DESPERATE holidaymakers have been using their kids to bag poolside sunbeds at a Spanish resort. Footage from the Melia Hotel in Benidorm showed tourists - armed with their beach towels - sprinting to sunbeds as soon as the gates opened to the pool area. Clare Fairbrother, 49, was on holiday with her husband David, 50, and daughter Lily, 10, and described the scenes as ""crazy"". The family had booked a VIP package which meant that the family's sunbeds were already reserved. But other holidaymakers had to queue up to join the frantic race for poolside sunbeds. And Clare said some took drastic action by sending their speedy kids into the chaos to bag loungers for their families. Clare, from Cheshire , said: ""We were sat in the VIP area watching at breakfast time. ""We also had our own reserved sunbed area, which is part of the premium room we got. ""About 50 people in the queue and 20 of them ran. ""I didn't see it get violent, but people were sending their children ahead first as they are quicker I think. ""The hotel restricted the doors being open to the sunbed area until 9am, so people queued up then ran when the door opened. ""As I said, no need to run there's loads of sunbeds."" Clare posted the footage on TikTok - with some followers describing it as the ""sprint of shame"". Another wrote: ""Looks like a nightmare of a place to stay."" A third said: ""My idea of hell."" It comes after one hotel hired a security guard to break up fights as Brits get up before dawn to battle other holidaymakers for sunbeds. The Sun joined the early morning towel brigade as they started to queue for the prime location by the pool before sunrise in Spain . Sunset Beach Club hotel in Benalmádena on the Costa Del Sol is one of the worst battlegrounds for spats over sunbeds . Hundreds of Brits are forced to queue from the early hours if they want to be in with a chance of a lounger. A bouncer in a bright blue top with SEGURIDAD arrived as there were more than 100 people waiting in a massive queue which snaked back into the hotel. And in Benidorm, one distressed mum burst into tears after she got caught up in the chaotic sunbed wars . Cayleigh Tuffs, 34, said she didn't manage to secure a spot as Brits were ""swarming like ants"" to reserve a space by the pool. The mum splashed out £2,000 for a Jet2 package holiday to Magic Aqua Rock Gardens in the Spanish hotspot with her husband Andrew 37, and eight-year-old daughter Charley. But on their first day, they realised they would have to take part in sunbed wars and start queuing early if they wanted to beat other holidaymakers and secure a spot by the pool. Cayleigh from Chesterfield, Derbyshire , told the Sun Online: ""They're like ants scurrying for food. It's horrendous. ""We've seen people throw towels across the pool to get beds and people are running even though it's massively slippery. ""We go on holiday five times a year and this is the first time we've ever seen anything like this. ""On the first day, we got here in the afternoon so there was no chance of getting a bed so we sat under a slide to get some shade. ""I was nearly in tears, it was horrendous. I've never wanted to cry on holiday before, but I did on that first day."" The mum who works as an IT manager noticed the pool is packed with queuing Brits an hour before it opens at 10am then ""chaos"" ensues when the gates are opened by staff. The mum said there are at least three different entrances to the pool and some even resorted to using a ""sneaky"" entrance near the toilet blocks.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836988520.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/using-speedy-kids-grab-loungers-836988242.png",Brits take drastic action to bag sunbeds at Spanish resorts – using their speedy KIDS to grab loungers first,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23410139/brits-send-kids-bag-sunbeds-spanish-resorts/
"ARMING his men with chainsaws and using victims' heads ""like footballs"", his thirst for blood even outshone his infamous predecessor. Bu Otoniel , the ruthless Colombian drug lord touted as the successor to Pablo Escobar , has now finally been caged after a breathless manhunt that stretched over a decade. The 51-year-old - whose real name is Dairo Antonio Usuga - was arrested in 2021 and extradited last year to face drug trafficking charges in the US, before being sentenced to 45 years behind bars this week. A new documentary tells how his men chopped off the limbs and heads of innocent villagers suspected of supporting a rival organisation. When his brother Giovanni was shot dead by the authorities, Usuga responded by offering to pay $1,000 for every police officer that was killed. Otoniel’s fearsome Gulf Clan firebombed trucks and buses and shot at any citizen who dared to come out onto the streets as he wreaked revenge. The US authorities offered a $5million reward for his capture and more than 1,200 troops and police were involved in the manhunt. Hundreds of security forces are believed to have been killed by his Gulf Clan, including the 17 police officers who died when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed searching for the boss in 2015. Otoniel eluded elite forces and a team of international secret agents by travelling through the northern mountains on the back of a donkey and not using a mobile phone. Finally in October 2021, in an operation that needed 22 helicopters and a force of 500, he was captured during a shoot out. Afterwards Colombia’s then president Ivan Duque said: “This criminal is only comparable to Pablo Escobar - he is not only the most dangerous drug trafficker in the world but also a murderer of social leaders, an abuser of children and adolescents, a murderer of police officers, and one of the most dangerous criminals on the planet.” Anyone who watches the second episode of the National Geographic series Drug Lords: The Takedown will see that is not an overstatement. The episode, titled The Animal, tells how a peasant rose to be the South American nation’s most feared kingpin. Bloody drug baron Daniel Barrera, known as El Loco, described Otoniel as an ""animal"" after being arrested in 2012. Born in Necoclí on the north coast, not far from the border with Panama, Otoniel joined the left wing Popular Liberation Army guerilla group at the age of 18. But he had little interest in the politics of the organisation and later switched sides to the right-wing United Self-Defences of Colombia - AUC. This pro-government group was supposed to be waging war against the Marxist terror organisation called FARC . In reality AUC and FARC were killing each other and innocent civilians in a bid to control the cocaine trade . It is estimated that 70 per cent of the world’s supply of the highly addictive drug comes from Colombia. The AUC terrorised any village suspected of being sympathetic to their enemies. In 1997 Otoniel and his brother were part of a team that spent five days killing 49 people in Mapiripán. Villager Viviana tells the film: “They took my father. They killed them with chainsaws. A man had his head cut off, they say they played soccer with it.” It was one of the darkest moments in the country’s history, but the Usuga brothers went free when the AUC signed a peace deal with the government in 2006. Those demobilised forces splintered into 30 criminal gangs, with Otoniel and Giovanni joining the Gulf Clan. Giovanni took control of the powerful mob, providing the brains, while Otoniel was the brawn. They made money from human trafficking, smuggling cocaine and child abuse. In 2010 the US authorities made the Gulf Clan a prime target, but one anti-drugs expert says they were very hard to pin down. Hank Crawford, the former head of Britain’s counter narcotics team in Latin America, recalls: “Capturing kingpins is difficult wherever you are in the world. “The two brothers were extremely hard to take down. They would never spend two nights in the same place.” Only on New Year’s Eve 2011 was a team of jungle commandos operating at night able to kill Giovanni in a 20-minute firefight. Peter Vincent, a former attache to the US Department of Justice, didn’t think it was a major problem that Otoniel was not found. He admits: “We were lulled into a false sense of security with the death of Giovanni.” Otoniel proves to be a far more cunning and deadly foe than his brother. Towns and villages were shut down, with citizens scared to leave their homes as Otoniel’s men roamed the streets with AK-47 machine guns. Jay Bergman, the former Andean Regional Director for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, says: “Otoniel is enemy number one.” Bergman’s agents couldn’t find their man in the mountains, so they decided to arrest his henchmen instead. But 150 arrests, including Otoniel’s wife Blanca Madrid and 14 other family members, did not bring him out into the open. It is alleged he had encouraged Blanca to have plastic surgery - and did the same with her three sisters - María, Sandra and Martha - so they all looked the same, reports Semana . Otoniel is said to have believed that black magic would protect him. But it was his ailing health that led to his downfall. He needed a type of medication to treat kidney disease to be delivered and that helped the authorities to find his jungle hideout in Uraba on October 22, 2021. To be sure, though, teams were sent to various possible locations all at the same time and Navy ships were stationed at sea to prevent him escaping via the water. Otoniel faced 122 charges in Colombia and was convicted of massacres, murder, disappearances, forced displacement and the recruitment of minors. He was extradited in May 2022 to the United States. During his trial in New York in January he admitted having trafficked 97 tons of cocaine to the US. But the trade in cocaine does not end, with other criminals quickly stepping in to fill the void he left behind. Wesley Tabor, a former DEA special agent in South America, tells The Sun: ""Is this ever going to be over? I don't think it ever will be, because I don't think we will ever curb this appetite for cocaine. ""In the 32 years I have been in this business I haven't just seen these drugs become more plentiful, but also cheaper.""

"A YOUNG footballer was shocked to death after diving in a swimming pool to get his phone back. Emiliano Sanchez Tavitas, 14, was reportedly electrocuted when the underwater lights in a luxury resort 's pool came on during his dip. Paramedics battled for 50 minutes to save the boy before declaring him dead due to a cardio-respiratory arrest. At least five other swimmers also received shocks at the Dream Lagoon complex's Crystal Lagoon pool in Apodaca, in the outskirts of Monterrey, Mexico . They were all shocked at 7:30 pm on Saturday when the pool's lights came on as the sun was going down. A 13-year-old girl lost consciousness but was revived. Emiliano's mother Denisse Tavitas has attacked official reports that described her son's death as an ""unfortunate accident"". She said her son's death ""was not an accident"", but he was killed by shoddy building work and negligence. ""Emi my beautiful boy... died as a result of an electric shock while he was inside a pool owned by the subdivision #CystalLagoonsApodaca, when the internal lights came on due to inadequate installation and lack of maintenance,"" Denisse wrote on social media. The grieving mother said she asked the company in charge of the work to accept responsibility and said they had ""falsified everything"". Denisse has filed a complaint with the Nuevo Leon State Attorney General's Office. ""We know that in an environment loaded with corruption, anything can be possible,"" she said. She also slammed those in charge of the pool, saying that the lighting area has since been covered and tied down with straps. ""They will do anything so that there is no evidence of the event. Help me find #JusticeForEmi,"" she said. Emiliano, a student at the Liceo de Apodaca, was about to enter his final year at school. He enjoyed playing football and flag football, known as ""tochito"" in Mexico. His body was veiled and later buried in a cemetery in La Estanzuela, in southern Monterrey. A mass was celebrated for the late boy, where friends and loved ones held a minute of applause and released coloured balloons into the sky. Dream Lagoons is an ongoing building project that features a large artificial lake, with crystal clear water and luxury apartments and houses built around it. An investigation is ongoing to establish the responsible party for the incident, Mexican media reported.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/emiliano-sanchez-tavitas-14-poses-836961053.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/poses-unidentified-man-undated-photo-836961045.jpg","Footballer, 14, electrocuted to death in swimming pool after diving in at luxury resort to get his phone back",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23412419/footballer-14-electrocuted-to-death-swimming-pool-mexico/
"A BENIDORM legend on the frontlines of the sunbed wars has claimed the battle is intensifying - with selfish Brits getting more and more outrageous. Jade, a legendary stag do performer at the party resort, told The Sun Online of the horrors she's seen when the poolside gates open up and the first wave charges the poolside loungers. The 30-year-old has lived in sunny Spain for eight years and recalls every holiday season being as chaotic as the last. ""Sunbed wars have been going on for years,"" she told The Sun Online. ""The pool area opens at a certain time of morning and people literally race, pushing each other out of the way trying to grab those sunbeds"". In her years of experience living and holidaying across the Spanish islands, the entertainer, known as Benidorm Jade , believes that it's the Brits and the Germans causing the most havoc. ""It used to be said that it was the Germans that were the worst,"" she revealed, ""but I think it has turned out that the Brits are, to be honest"". ""Benidorm is so popular with the British and there's so many of us here - I think they've kind of taken over on the sunbed wars"". Some Brits kick-off when they told off by hotel staff - including one incident where they dumped the towels in pool as a couple had not been seen. Jade explained: "" They even said themselves they had spent the afternoon in the pub and had not intended to use the beds until later in the afternoon despite putting their towels down to reserve in the morning."" ""People are even putting towels down in the middle of the night, and are then surprised when their towels are either gone or the towel and bed being used by someone else,"" she went on. ""This is causing heated arguments even though many hotels have policies not allowing this."" She described the scenes as ""surreal to watch"" as the resort expert recalled listening to people's constant ""bickering and arguing over the best positions"" and people fuming over ""Who's stolen my towel from six hours ago?"" ""There are all these heated debates going on, all these kinds of arguments - aren't you meant to be on holiday, and here we are arguing at 7am in the morning,"" she said. As the phenomenon of sunbed wars in sunshine resorts continues to become increasingly popular, Jade says the whole idea is ""unfair"" to the people that just want to relax by the pool for an hour. ""People are reserving the beds with towels and not intending to use them and now there's nowhere for anyone else to sit,"" she said. And not only are the manic dashes to claiming the deckchairs ""irritating"" to many holidaymakers but also a complete waste of time, according to the resort expert. ""Like really, why would you want to spoil your holiday over a petty argument?"" she said. This comes as a Spanish hotel was forced to hire a security guard to break up fights as Brits were spotted getting up at the crack of dawn to battle other holidaymakers for sunbeds. Another distressed mum burst into tears after she got caught in Benidorm's chaotic sunbed dash as she said the desperate Brits were ""swarming like ants"".

"A MYSTERIOUS ""Man in White"" is terrorising a local neighbourhood amid claims he looks like the character from a slasher film series. Frightened neighbours said the creepy man goes prowling the streets of Coacalco, Mexico , dressed in white from head to toe. Many locals compared him to the horror character Art the Clown from the Terrifier movie series. Some residents said he is approachable and friendly - while others claimed he's menacing, with bloodstains sometimes visible around his mouth. Neighbours assume that he isn’t a homeless person as his white costume is always as clean. TikTok user @ElTobi shared a clip of him that went viral with 1.7 million views. “Despite the testimonies of many people saying he is a peaceful person, there are others who say he follows people and steals products from market stalls,"" the narrator claims. “Everyone takes it as a joke, but I'm curious to know who he is or why he does that,”one resident said. Another added: “I see him every day, he always runs about 10 km or more a day, he is always in white and dashes between the cars.” “Why doesn’t someone call 911? It is clear that something is wrong,” a third asked. “I’ve seen him, and the truth is he scared me,” a fourth commented. A few users pointed out the creepy resemblance to the Terrifier character. “I don’t know why, he reminds me of Terrifier,"" one wrote. “That is how Terrifier begins,"" another added. But some decided to laugh it off, commending ""Man in White"" for his squeaky clean outfit. A user named Peter joked: “What detergent does he use? My clothes don't stay white for even an hour!”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mystery-creepy-man-white-terrorises-836974434.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mystery-creepy-man-white-terrorises-836974511.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mystery-creepy-man-white-terrorises-836974429.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mystery-creepy-man-white-terrorises-836974420.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mystery-creepy-man-white-terrorises-836974553.jpg",Mystery of terrifying ‘Man in White’ with ‘bloodstains around his mouth’ spotted prowling streets menacing locals,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23413200/mystery-terrifying-man-in-white-blood-tiktok-mexico-horror/
"DOZENS of migrants are dead after their ship sank just hours into their treacherous journey to Italy. At least 41 people, including children, have died in the shipwreck off the island of Lampedusa, survivors of the disaster said. The 20ft boat had set off from Sfax in Tunisia with 45 people onboard, including three children, on Thursday. But it ran into trouble only six hours after departing when a huge wave slammed into the doomed vessel. The ship began to take on water as soon as it reached the open sea. ""Suddenly we were overwhelmed by a giant wave,"" one survivor told the coastguard. Only 15 migrants were wearing lifejackets, although this seems to have failed to save their lives. Four survivors - a 13-year-old boy, two men and a woman - floated on inner tubes and lifejackets before finding another empty boat. Stranded at sea, they spent several days drifting in the water before they were finally rescued,  German rescue charity Sea-Watch said. Heartwrenching images show the survivors frantically waving for help as rescuers approached. The group was initially saved by the Maltese-flagged bulk carrier Rimona in the Straits of Sicily, according to reports. The Italian coastguard later took over and transported them to Lampedusa. Local public prosecutor Salvatore Vella said he had opened an investigation into the tragedy. The survivors, originally from the Ivory Coast and Guinea, arrived in Lampedusa on Wednesday suffering from exhaustion and shock. Doctor Adrian Chiaramonte said they had received treatment for minor injuries. He said: ""What really struck us was the story of the tragedy. ""They said they had encountered a first ship, which had apparently ignored them. ""An hour later they were spotted by a helicopter, and an hour after that sighting, they were picked up by an oil tanker."" Two shipwrecks in the area were reported by the Italian coast guard on Sunday, but it is unclear whether it referred to the migrant's boat. Over 1,800 people have died during the deadly crossing from North Africa to Europe so far this year. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said those onboard would have had little chance of survival. A spokesman for the United Nations agency said: ""Sub-Saharan migrants [leaving from Tunisia] are forced to use these low-cost iron boats which break after 20 or 30 hours of navigation. ""With this kind of sea, these boats capsize easily."" According to The Guardian, like half the boats used recently in crossings from Tunisia , the boat did not have an engine.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-migrants-far-made-way-837025070-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/000-migrants-far-made-way-837009678.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/long-left-sfax-thursday-last-837017731.jpg",Lampedusa shipwreck: Dozens dead including children after migrant ship sank HOURS after starting treacherous journey,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23413994/lampedusa-shipwreck-dozens-dead-including-children-migrants-sink/
"THIS eerie hotel in a scenic Brit holiday hotspot was used as a filming set for a smash HBO show and is now owned by a Russian billionaire. The Hotel Belvedere in Dubrovnik, Croatia , has a history as interesting as the storylines seen on Game of Thrones . First built in 1985, the astounding 18-storey building boasted over 200 rooms, a helicopter pad and a private boat dock on the crystal blue waters of the Adriatic Sea. But when the Balkans conflict kicked off in the 1990s, the Serbian Army dramatically bombed the port city to try to push out Croatian soldiers. The hotel even housed refuges between 1991 and 1995. Despite the decay, the formerly breathtaking hotel has been used for a very different purpose since the violent siege. Outdoor explorers have explored the ruins of the five-star hotel, and shared photos in the rubble. The most defining feature of the hotel is the massive spiral staircase in the middle of the building. And the stunning outdoor amphitheatre was used as a location for season four of Game of Thrones. Characters Oberyn and the Mountain duelled in front of a crowd at the Belvedere, making it a popular destination for fans to trek to. [ADD COUPLE MORE PARS ON THE FILMING LOCATION & GOT] Meanwhile, The Belvedere has another enticing attraction - groups of stray Croatian kitties have made the old building their home. One explorer remarked: ""The only life that can be found today on Hotel Belvedere's grounds are the local street cats, lounging in the sun and wallowing in their eternal desire for a passer-by to offer them a snack, a far cry from the past. ""Today you can still see the ruins of the hotel, abandoned and unloved except by the furry felines who frequent its corridors."" Shortly after the Game of Thrones cast filmed on location, the legendary hotel was purchased at auction by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg. He purchased the Belvedere in 2014 for £10million - but has yet to make any changes to the property. The property purchase is a far cry from the billionaire's usual taste which includes 15 Fabergé eggs - the most owned by one single person in the world. On the opposite side of Dubrovnik, other abandoned hotels provide a sinister background for sunbathing holidaymakers. But as well as being gawped at by tourists, the ruins have been used for filming of the upcoming biopic Lee, about renowned World War 2 Vogue journalist Lee Miller. According to local reports, it was one of several locations in Croatia Kate Winslet and Jude Law shot scenes last September. With the Grand Hotel as its crowning jewel, the site features several other hotels - Pelegrin, Goricine I, Goricine II, Kupari and Galeb - able to accommodate thousands of guests. It remains unclear what the future of these derelict hotels will be, but many are rumoured to be set for destruction to pave way for new hotels.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/048074f1-2fe2-47ec-97a9-a307d22e1465.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/br3pce-hotel-belvedere-836645213.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cadff31e-0974-4516-9329-b1f518a12efc.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000836654569.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/t40edj-lena-headey-cersei-lannister-483445649.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/j7552k-hotel-belvedere-damaged-abandoned-836645307.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-star-hotel-located-slope-836645414.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/five-star-hotel-located-slope-836645350.jpg",Inside eerie 18-storey abandoned hotel on Croatia cliff edge used as Games of Thrones set & owned by Russian billionaire,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23374898/abandoned-croatia-hotel-war-game-of-thrones/
"TIM Shaddock, who was lost at sea for two months with his dog, has been faced with fresh heartache after being forced to give her up. The Australian sailor, 51, was rescued from the Pacific Ocean last week alongside his pooch , Bella. But after finally being hauled back to dry land by his rescuers, Tim had to abandon his castaway canine pal who ""found him"" while he was travelling in Mexico. “Bella sort of found me in the middle of Mexico . She’s Mexican,” he told the New York Post . “She’s the spirit of the middle of the country and she wouldn’t let me go. “I tried to find a home for her three times and she just kept following me onto the water. She’s a lot braver than I am, that’s for sure"". Tim, although left heartbroken, decided to leave the pup in the capable hands of a crew member from the Marie Delia who had come to his rescue. He then jetted back to his native Australia. Tim said he had chosen crew member Genaro Rosales to care for Bella - and he had assured him she would be well looked after. Bringing pets to Australia can be a lengthy and expensive process involving cats and dogs being microchipped, vaccinated and undergoing quarantine periods - even from ""approved"" countries. Mexico is not an approved country for pet importation in Australia, making the hurdles to bring Bella back even higher. She would likely have had to spend time in another country, and be cared for there, before even being considered entry to Australia. After being rescued, the 51-year-old who had grown long hair and beard, revealed that he and Bella survived off raw fish and rain water while the pair were lost at sea. The former IT specialist, had set out in April from La Paz, Mexico, on a 3,728-mile voyage to French Polynesia . But weeks into the challenge, his vessel was damaged in a storm that downed its electronic and navigation systems. The stranded duo were eventually rescued after two gruelling months at sea, 1930km from land, by the tuna trawler Marie Delia after being spotted by a chopper. The vessel then returned them to Mexican land. Tim said he was “so grateful” to be alive and described the moment he saw the helicopter that alerted the trawler to his location. “This land I’m on currently is amazing, you know, it’s really good. I’m grateful to be here,” he said. “It made me feel like I was going to live, you know. The helicopter was the first I have seen of any boat for three months.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-shaddock-left-mexico-aiming-832380255-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-photo-provided-grupomar-atun-832467900.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-australian-sailor-dog-rescued-832592675.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-photo-provided-grupomar-atun-832467898.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-australian-sailor-dog-rescued-832592034.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-australian-sailor-dog-rescued-832569282.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-australian-sailor-dog-rescued-832569289.jpg","Tim Shaddock, 51, who was lost at sea for MONTHS hit with fresh heartache as he’s forced to abandon dog who ‘saved’ him",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23112382/tim-shaddock-lost-sea-months-forced-abandon-dog/
"DESPERATE tyrant Vladimir Putin has conscripted pensioners to fight in Ukraine after raising the maximum mobilisation age to 70. The real-life dad’s army will see OAPs return to the army – even if they had already been discharged. A change to Russia ’s laws signed off by the nation’s rubber-stamp Parliament extends the age groups mad Vlad – who is himself 70 – can recall to active service. The switch means retired reservists with top-level military experience can be drafted back into the army until they hit 70. Senior generals will be forced to serve until 60, and junior officials can also be recalled until they turn 55 – ten years older than previous laws allowed. Hundreds of thousands of men of fighting age fled Russia in September after Putin ordered a mobilisation without warning. And earlier this year Russia altered draft laws to combat 250,000 “missing” conscripts whose notices had been lost in the post – with conscription letters now delivered by email. It comes as South Africa confirmed Putin would not attend next month’s BRICS summit in person due to his international arrest warrant. South African police would have been obliged to arrest the warmongering dictator as he landed due to the country’s membership of the International Criminal Court. Putin had been scheduled to jet to the African state for the international conference, but will now appear virtually after reaching a “mutual” agreement with conference organisers. Russia previously said it took any effort to arrest Putin as a declaration of war. At least 47,000 Russian troops are now believed to have been killed in Ukraine - although the Kremlin acknowledges only 6,000 deaths. The invasion has left birth rates at their lowest since Putin took power 23 years ago, according to official statistics, sparking fresh fears of a demographic collapse as thousands of young men die on the frontlines. Putin’s health chief Mikhail Murashko urged Russian women to have children rather than pursue prestigious careers that prevent them from parenting “a third or fourth child”.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/russian-president-vladimir-putin-attends-832802298.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2018-vladimir-putin-one-day-717025163.jpg",Vladimir Putin conscripts OAPs to fight in Ukraine after raising Russian army’s  maximum mobilisation age to 70,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23112349/vladimir-putin-conscripts-pensioners-ukraine-war-mobilisation-age/
"GERMAN cops have urged people to stay indoors as a suspected lioness was spotted on the loose in the capital. Officers advised the residents of Berlin 's southern suburbs not to leave their houses and to keep their pets indoors. A massive police operation is underway in the area including a helicopter and thermal imaging cameras to locate the missing animal. A police spokesperson said: ""We have deployed massive forces at the site to protect the population."" Authorities in Brandenburg state warned residents in the districts of Kleinmachnow, Teltow and Stahnsdorf to watch out for a potentially dangerous animal, suspected to be a lioness, that is on the loose. The warning came after locals reported seeing a predator, seemingly a lioness, attacking a wild boar. Terrified residents told BILD how they were instructed to stay indoors home with some being forced to lock up their pets at home as they headed to work. Mariam B. who brought her children to the Ameisenburg daycare centre in the morning told BILD : ""The lioness must have been right on our doorstep because the police searched there very intensively!"" ""Dogs were barking all over the neighborhood. We were told over the loudspeaker that we were not allowed to leave the house. ""Now we were finally allowed to take our children to the daycare centre."" Another local mother, Beate Geeske, said: ""I think it's good that the children aren't allowed out. ""But I didn't worry too much on the way here. I walked where there are still people on the street.” Five hunters with tranquiliser guns are reportedly combing the area alongside veterinarians to find the animal. Two men reported seeing a big cat running after a wild boar, the latter common in and around Berlin , police spokesman Daniel Kiep said. He said: ""Around midnight, witnesses saw a predator tearing down a wild boar. ""We also got video material about it. It is therefore a lioness. There is currently no reason for us to doubt its authenticity."" He added that zoos, animal parks, circuses and animal sanctuaries had been checked but none of them is missing a lioness. ""We don't know where it came from,"" he said. Brandenburg Police tweeted this morning: ""The wild animal that escaped has not yet been found! ""We ask you not to leave your houses."" Vet Dr. Fred Willizkat told the outlet that lions on the loose are not necessarily hungry but they're unpredictable. ""That's what makes it dangerous,"" he said. ""A lion can attack anything that he doesn't know and that scares him."" Vets and hunters are participating in a search for the beast. A Kleinmachnow spokesperson said children at kindergartens are not allowed to enter the gardens, while sellers at local markets were advised not to set up stalls yet. She added: ""There are hardly any people there. This sort of thing doesn't happen every day."" It's not the first time Germans have been told to be on the lookout for wild animals on the loose. In May, residents in the central German city of Erfurt were jolted by the sight of a kangaroo hopping across a busy road after escaping from a private property. In 2016, German zookeepers had to shoot dead a lion after it escaped from its enclosure in the eastern city of Leipzig and a tranquiliser failed to stop it.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c55b083f-6b26-4228-b23a-2b72a019e073.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/109ec416-c80c-47c2-b7b8-591c20bd18a0.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-bild-de-regional-berlin-832921741.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8cbf902e-a97a-4281-9989-1b0b65a0af97.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-authorities-warned-people-832906814.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-authorities-warned-people-832908111.jpg",Escaped lion on the loose in Berlin as beast spotted ‘with kill’ & people warned it could attack anyone,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23103349/lion-loose-german-capital-berlin-cops-people-stay-inside/
"BEACHGOERS fled from the water in a hurry as a shark lurked nearby on a popular Portuguese beach. Startled locals and holidaymakers at the Portuguese resort city of Espinho ran away terrified and screamed "" shark "" as it got closer to the shore. Children were seen huddling near the shoreline and shouting ""shark"" as lifeguards monitored the creature. A brave sun-seeker in the water initially turned his back on it and began walking slowly back towards the beach before stopping to stare at the beast. Despite the initial panic on shore, the shark soon disappeared after swimming back into deeper water. Beachgoers are understood to have been allowed to return to the water once it had left the area. Espinho, a city in the north of Portugal close to Porto is known for fishing and its perfect beaches, while Praia de Espinho beach is considered the finest in the area. Brits who have spent time there have left glowing reviews online, with one describing it as “great with a fantastic sunset.” It comes as two sharks were spotted moving through shallow waters near the Costa Brava beach of Portbou on Sunday. Dramatic footage showed how the blue sharks swam stomach-churningly close to people in the water. The creature's surprise visit caused chaos as stunned swimmers cooling off from the Spanish sun raced to escape the danger. Following the incident, Portbou mayor Gael Rodrigues issued a message of reassurance saying: ""Portbou beach is completely safe."" He added that blue sharks are often spotted off beaches in the municipality because they are native to the area. Blue sharks rarely bite humans, but have been implicated in several biting incidents, four of which are said to have ended fatally. A series of blue sharks have been sighted close to Spanish beaches this year. In June, it seemed that sharks appeared to be swarming off Spain - but scientists were completely stumped as to what could be drawing them to the shore. Dr Gavin Naylor, director of The Florida Program of Shark Research, said scientists at this stage simply cannot know what appears to be drawing in the predatory fish. But he did assure tourists that the area is not becoming a ""dangerous hotspot"" - and said the shark flurry could be a one-off event. Blue sharks - which can grow up to 10ft long and weigh up to 200kg - appear to be behind most of the sightings in June. And there was one "" very unusual"" sighting of a massive cow shark - a species that usually lives right at the bottom of the sea, which approached a group of fisherman. Dr Naylor said right now there is no explanation for the sightings - but speculated that a mix of conditions such as water temperatures, food and changing shark nurseries could explain the encounters. Five sharks came close to the shoreline in different parts of Spain within a period of just 10 days in June. The first episode occurred on June 15 when bathers were filmed running to safety at Aguamarina beach in Orihuela, south of Alicante. The same day it emerged that a species of shark had been spotted inside Ciutadella Port in Menorca. Another seven-foot blue shark was filmed gliding through the water at a small cove in Ibiza called Calo des Moltons on June 24.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shark-spotted-praia-da-baia-832902143.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shark-spotted-praia-da-baia-832902148.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shark-spotted-praia-da-baia-832902134.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shark-spotted-praia-da-baia-832902146.jpg",Massive shark spotted lurking off Portugese beach sending panicked tourists fleeing water as children scream,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23113978/shark-portugese-beach-panicked-tourists-fleeing/
"BRITISH ice hockey star Mike Hammond has been killed in a horror car crash in Canada, his former club has announced. Tributes are pouring in for the ex-Nottingham Panthers player, 33, after the fatal incident in the village of Shawnigan Lake yesterday. The sportsman passed away last night from his injuries, the Panthers said in a statement this morning.

"TWO women were paraded down the street naked in India after being sexually assaulted by a large mob, police say. The harrowing footage of the alleged attacks by hundreds of men on the young women has triggered outrage and protests across the violence-stricken state of Manipur. Police say that the assault on the women occurred on May 4, but the video went viral late on Wednesday despite internet being largely blocked inside the state. It shows two naked women being surrounded by scores of young men - alleged to be near 1000 - who groped them and dragged them to a field. A police complaint alleges one woman was gang raped and two other male family members were killed, before the mob went on to burn down their village. The Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF) condemned the attack on the woman as “sickening” and alleged that one woman was gang raped. Furious protesters have taken to the streets to denounce the horror attack and call an end to the violence in the northeastern state. Congresswomen and women's organisations have led the protests and demanded the resignation of Manipur's Chief Minister, Biren Singh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the incident had ""shamed India"" and that ""no guilty will be spared"". ""I assure the nation, the law will take its course with all its might. ""What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,"" he said, breaking more than two months of silence over deadly ethnic clashes in India's northeast. According to a police complaint filed on May 18, the two women were part of a family attacked by a mob of between 800-1000 men. The family were said to be fleeing the attack on their village through the forest when they met local police who said they would take them to safety. The compliant claims that they were: “blocked on the way by a mob and snatched from the custody of the police team"". A 56-year-old was said to have been killed on the spot as his three female family members were forced to strip. A 21-year-old woman in the group was reportedly ""brutally gang raped in broad daylight"". Her “younger brother tried to defend his sister’s modesty and life but he was murdered by members of the mob on the spot,” it adds. Manipur Chief Minister Biren Singh said that arrests had been made, without specifying the number of people who were apprehended. ""A thorough investigation is currently underway and we will ensure strict action is taken against all the perpetrators, including considering the possibility of capital punishment,"" Singh said.

"AN IBIZA beach beloved by Brits has been closed indefinitely after officials made a deadly discovery. The sands of s'Aigua Blanca have been ruled a danger to the public following a week of powerful waves and stormy weather . The Santa Eulària Town Council fear the tumultuous conditions could trigger a deadly landslide, forcing its indefinite closure. The beach has been plagued by coastal erosion in recent years, which has snatched the sand from the shore and caused cracks in the cliffs. It shut last Friday after the local authority warned the area, which is typically packed with holidaymakers, was at risk of landslides. It seems the beach will now remain off-limits for the rest of the summer as officials revealed there had been very little improvement. The council have been reviewing the area on a daily basis to monitor the vanishing line of sand as well as the force of the waves. Although the strip has grown slightly since last week, ""for the moment the conditions have not changed"". Signage warning of the dangers and the closure are now guarding the entrances. Ferocious waves have been bombarding the rocks along the ""open"" beach, smashing full force into the coastline. As well as eroding the lower parts of the cliffs, creating a risk of rockfalls, it could also prompt a horrific landslide. This occurs when the gravity pulling on the rocks exceeds the stability and friction provided by the underlying sandstone, according to the Maine Geological Survey. When the pull of gravity exceeds the ability to support the weight and unstable slopes buckle, it can trigger a landslide. The popular beach, which Brit tourists often flock to, was also closed last year due to the high risk of landslides. The municipal government said urgent measures were required to secure the area and prevent rockfalls that could injure beachgoers. Experts were able to identify several large cracks in the cliffs and noted the existing materials were disintegrated with little support. Two tourists were injured in July 2021 by falling debris on the s'Aigua Blanca beach, seeing officials close it for a short period. Brits are now struggling to find a place to catch some rays in Ibiza after another beach was closed following a disgusting discovery. Visitors have been told to avoid the Playa Es Pinet, after the cove's water was found to contain faecal matter . According to local media, the amount of unsavoury material in the beach's surrounding sea ""exceeded"" approved safety levels. And the contaminated coastline even posed a risk of E. Coli and intestinal Enterococcus bacteria, the local Department of the Environment said .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wide-angle-view-long-stretch-832935360.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/santa-eul-ria-keeps-s-832935626.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ibiza-beach-aigua-blanca-santa-832935389.jpg",Ibiza beach popular with Brits is closed INDEFINITELY after deadly discovery,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23115606/ibiza-beach-closed-indefinitely-deadly-discovery/
"THE so-called ""ugliest city in the world"" is filled with decrepit buildings and boarded-up homes. Charleroi in Belgium was once the heart of the country's coal industry, but has been left to rot in the last decades. Today, its factories lie abandoned and the scars of the mining industry still ravage the city. Speaking to The Sun Online , artist Nicolas Buissart, who runs tours around his home city, explained why he loves the gritty charm. In 2009, readers of the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant branded Charleroi the ""ugliest city in the universe"". Nicolas said that when the article came out, it was the ""perfect marketing opportunity"" for Charleroi. ""If you are seen as an ugly city, you might as well be 'the ugliest',"" he explained. He made a website with his friend advertising the "" Charleroi Adventure "", and before long, they were having hundreds of people signing up for their tours. Nicolas says that at first, local authorities and tourist groups hated him, but little by little, they have been embraced. ""At first, the authorities blamed me for spreading the image of Charleroi as a depressing place,"" he said. The city gained more notoriety after it was revealed paedophile serial killer Marc Dutroux kept his kidnapped victims chained up in a suburban dungeon there. Earlier this year, authorities began tearing down the terraced house where the worst of his crimes were committed. Since 2009, it had been boarded up and covered with a mural of a young girl on a sand dune flying a kite. In recent years, however, official tour guides in the city have begun offering their own visits to abandoned factories and even creating maps of the ruins for themselves. ""My tours start in the city centre,"" Nicolas explained, ""but they differ depending on the makeup of the group."" Nicolas's tour groups can range from school kids to stag dos to members of the European Commission. ""I explain the history of Charleroi, and then we move to the factories,"" he said. ""I have keys to some of the abandoned buildings, so I show people around. ""If the weather is good, we can climb a slag heap - which is the waste material produced from mining. Then there are bars that we can visit. ""For bigger groups, we can have a barbecue by the riverside."" If you are seen as an ugly city, you might as well be 'the ugliest' Belgium became industrialised after England , not long after gaining its independence in 1830. The south of the country, in Wallonia surrounding Charleroi, experienced a coal boom, becoming the industrial powerhouse of the country, earning the nickname the ""Black Country"". But after the 1950s, as coal's fortunes fell and oil became the dominant fuel, Belgium's industry moved to the north of the country and its North Sea coast. In a pattern repeated in much of the UK, US, and France , parts of Belgium went into major industrial decline. Charleroi has become notorious in recent decades for crime , deprivation, and general decline. Recent statistics show rampant unemployment figures at 20 per cent in Charleroi, compared to around 6 per cent nationwide . Just 40 miles south of Brussels, the city of 200,000 is marked by its dreary housing complexes and shuttered factories. It is also home to ""the ugliest road in Belgium,"" the meandering, grey Rue de Mons. Cultural anthropologist and war photographer Teun Voeten wrote in a feature on Charleroi : ""Drug users openly shoot up heroin in vacant buildings, while prostitutes ply their trade under overpasses on street corners just a few streets from the town hall."" He went on: ""Two of the five metro lines designed to serve the town have never been finished. Empty ghost stations now serve as stomping grounds for vandals, self-styled graffiti artists and junkies."" In recent years, the city has also struggled to shake off its associations with one of its most famous former residents - Belgian serial killer and paedophile Dutroux. He was arrested in 1996 for the kidnap, rape and torture of six girls between the ages of eight and 19, four of whom died. In June, his former ""house of horrors"" in Charleroi was finally torn down to make way for a public garden. The run-down shuttered terraced house was once a feature of Nicolas's ""urban safari"" tours of his home city. Is Nicolas concerned that his tours could help make Charleroi too trendy and gentrified, taking away the feature that makes it unique? ""Amsterdam was very cool in the 90s,"" he said. ""Now the people living there have become older, and the city has become more of a museum. ""Many of the 'cool' people have moved to Brussels, which was considered boring in the past, but is a lot cheaper than Amsterdam and Paris."" He added that a lot of the artists who now come to Charleroi still live in Brussels as the city still feels too rough for them to live there. It wasn't the case that Charleroi was just ""ugly"", Nicolas explained, but that it was ""boring"". The same socialist political party had run the city for 40 years and the middle class and upper class had moved out to the suburbs. People didn't want to come back to the city centre. Efforts have been made to clean up some of the most run-down parts of the city in recent years. Local authorities have laid bicycle routes alongside the former factories, while an old industrial complex has been transformed into a museum and education centre. Nicolas urges Brits to visit Charleroi and give his gritty city a chance. ""Charleroi is in the middle of everything,"" he said. ""It is only an hour from Brussels and Ghent on the train. And has some advice for any Brits who might want to make the trip to Charleroi for a holiday with a difference. ""We have a crazy disco in an abandoned factory called 'Rockerill',"" he said. ""If you like partying, come to Charleroi.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751707749.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751707751.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000738724721.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000018083651.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751707754.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751707746.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751706632.jpg",Inside ‘the UGLIEST city in the world’ filled with boarded-up homes & abandoned buildings,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/19421100/inside-ugliest-city-world-charleroi-belgium/
"TERRIFIED tourists are being evacuated from their hotels as raging wildfires are sweeping through a Greek island during Europe's deadly 42C heatwave Charon. The massive blaze erupted in Rhodes forcing hundreds to flee after it burned  ""uncontrollably"" through a pine forest in the centre of the island. At least three villages and a hotel were evacuated an alert by the Fire Service. The fire broke out on Tuesday afternoon in the area of Apollona and continued spreading through the island today even reaching its centre. Officials said the fire was ""out of control"" and already burnt through acres of land. A crew of 103 firefighters, water-bombing aircraft, and four choppers have been working to tackle the blaze on three fronts. Authorities have ordered the evacuation of the villages of Eleousa, Salakos, Dimilia, and the mountain of Profitis Ilias, where the Elafos Hotel is located. Local official Stergios Aggouras told Greek media that the fire has changed course due to strong winds adding that there hasn't been such a ""catastrophe on the island in years."" It comes as Greece is battling several wildfires that erupted as the country is being hit by scorching temperatures during a heatwave that has swept through southern Europe. Wildfires continued for a third day near the capital destroying forests and homes as the country is bracing for a new heatwave . The blaze that broke out in the village of Kouvaras on Monday - 30 miles from Athens- sent hundreds fleeing. Air water bombers resumed operations over the towns of Mandra, and Loutraki, as firefighters worked through the night to keep flames at bay. Flames kept roaring back to life as winds constantly changed direction, and thick smoke blanketed the wider area, state ERT TV said. Authorities ordered the evacuation of three areas, telling residents to head to the town of Megara. Four aircraft sent from Italy and France joined the efforts today authorities said. Firefighters across the country, boosted by crews from Romania , Poland and Slovakia , have been deployed to help battle the blazes. Dozens of homes were gutted and hundreds were forced to flee towering flames which seared through hamlets on Tuesday. The Greek meteorological service had warned of a heightened risk of fires this week, as the country recovers from the first major heatwave of the summer . A second heatwave was forecast to start on Thursday. ""Conditions are extreme, and are likely to be so for another week,"" Kostas Tsigas, head of the fire brigade officers association, told Greece 's SKAI TV. Are you near one of the wildfire areas? Email alikikraterou@thesun.co.uk or WhatsApp 07741005808 if you have any information. In southern Europe , forecasters have predicted temperatures could pass 46C. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. The current bout of heat belongs to a weather system originating in North Africa - an anticyclone dubbed ""Charon"". Charon refers to a character from Ancient Greek mythology - and follows on the heels of another high-pressure weather system, Cerberus, responsible for last week's sweltering heat. Holidaymakers and residents across the Mediterranean are being warned to avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine as the mercury rises in countries including Italy , Spain, France and Greece. France said today the mercury is expected to exceed 40C in parts of the country's south, including on the Mediterranean holiday island Corsica. In the Canary Islands, some 400 firefighters battled a blaze that has ravaged 3,500 hectares of forest and forced 4,000 residents to evacuate, with authorities warning people to wear face masks outside due to poor air quality. Other parts of Spain also saw extreme temperatures with three regions being on red alert. Meanwhile, the sizzling temperatures in Italy have caused a 25 per cent increase in the number of people at emergency units after suffering dehydration or a heatstroke, according to La Repubblica . The mercury in Rome hit a sweltering 41.8C as tourists visiting the Colosseum were seen collapsing on the ground. At least three people are believed to have died in Italy last week. The extreme weather caused the death of a 44-year-old man who collapsed while painting a zebra crossing in Milan at 40C. He was rushed to hospital but could not be saved. And two brothers, aged six and seven, died after they jumped into a reservoir in Manfredonia in southern Italy, reportedly to cool down.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-facebook-com-photo-fbid-832750449.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-facebook-com-photo-fbid-832750451.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-still-image-obtained-handout-832745487.jpg",Wildfires erupt on Greek holiday island as tourists are evacuated from resorts amid 42C Charon heatwave,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23106667/wildfires-erupt-greek-holiday-island-tourists-evacuated/
"STARTLED swimmers rushed to flee the water after spotting a pair of ferocious sharks prowling just feet away at a Spanish beach. Two fearsome fins were seen rising above the waves off the coast of Portbou in the Catalonia region on Sunday afternoon. Dramatic footage shows how the blue sharks swam stomach-churningly close to people in the water yesterday. The creatures' surprise visit caused chaos as stunned swimmers cooling off from the Spanish sun raced to escape the danger. Although some made it to shore, others were forced to take refuge on a crowded floating platform in the sea. They then had to be ferried back to dry land by kayakers. Those on the safety of the sand recorded the hair-raising moment when the sharks were seen menacingly patrolling the coastline. One was seen lurking in the shallow waters just feet away from two people while another was then spotted frolicking near the rocks. Despite the initial alarm, no injuries or incidents related to the sighting were reported. After the footage of the close encounter began to circulate online, Portbou mayor Gael Rodrigues reassured locals the ""beach is completely safe."" He explained that blue sharks are often spotted off beaches in the municipality because they are native to the area. The species, also known as Prionace glauca, can grow up to 13 feet in length and can weigh as much as 450lb. Blue sharks have been listed as ""near threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Spanish beaches have been swarmed by sharks in recent weeks , forcing some to temporarily close. A mystery sea creature sparked panic last week as beachgoers spotted a fin ominously emerging out of the water. Locals and tourists were seen running up and down the sand to alert swimmers as they feared a shark was about to launch an attack. Local police described the surprise guest on the shoreline as a Cuvier's beaked whale, the world’s deepest-diving mammal. In June, families were seen frantically running through waist-high water as a shark swam up beside them off a Costa Blanca beach. Days later, a tintorera or blue shark sparked panic at Aguamarina beach in Orihuela Costa south of Alicante. A shark was then spotted gliding through the water off a beach in Ibiza - marking the fifth sighting in Spain in just a week . Terrifying footage later emerged of another shark nearing the sands in Malaga , forcing Brits to flee to the shore. The Patalavaca beach in Mogan, Gran Canaria , was then closed after two hammerhead sharks were spotted prowling near the coast.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-despite-fear-present-no-832325527.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a65b4f5f-19cf-49c9-ab57-52de8e98755e.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-despite-fear-present-no-832315827.jpg",Horror moment TWO sharks spotted prowling Spanish beach as swimmers left fleeing water and being rescued by boats,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23079107/two-sharks-prowling-spanish-beach-swimmers-fleeing-water/
"A VIRAL TikTok clip that shows a woman ""frozen in time"" has left viewers convinced that the Matrix is real. The video of the unidentified woman has made its rounds on social media after she appeared to be stuck in a walking position in the middle of the street. In the freaky footage, the camera can be seen pointing to a woman in a black top and white trousers, with someone in the background saying: ""Why is she frozen? Bro. I’m tripping"". With one foot in front of the other, and her arms paused in motion as if they had been swinging by her side, the caption on the viral post read: ""She was like that for a minute before"". Even her long, blonde ponytail seemed to be paused before she suddenly resumed walking again. The cameraman can be heard saying: ""What the f**k?,"" as she continued as if nothing had happened. The spooky video has racked up a mega 5.3million views with stunned followers flocking to the comment section. One said: ""I’m telling you right now, that mfr … that mfr back there is not real"". Another wrote: ""I actually think the matrix is real"". A third commented: ""Glitch in the Matrix"" One more added: ""Nah even the hair was frozen"". ""The way the wind isn’t even moving her clothes or hair but it’s all just stuck completely frozen,"" said a fifth. Another chimed in: ""Sometimes I think we've slipped into a different dimension"". But this isn't the first time people have been left questioning whether the Matrix is real. In 2018, bizarre footage emerged of a plane that appeared to be suspended in mid-air. The real-life optical illusion was captured by baffled motorists just outside Moscow . The unusual video triggered intense online speculation as to the explanation for the illusion - with many viewers claiming it to be a ""glitch in the Matrix"". And in April people on social media were left mind-blown when the ""mirror reflection"" trend went viral on TikTok . In the puzzling optical illusion video posted online, a bloke held up an egg next to a mirror on the wall. But viewers were left stunned after he pointed the camera to the mirror as they could still see the reflection of the egg even though it wasn't in front of the mirror at all. Despite many saying logically the egg shouldn't be visible, it was, leaving thousands of people claiming it was ""a glitch in the Matrix obviously"", while others said it was just basic physics.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0c4d5f0d-2db6-492d-ad52-b994997aba45.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d4719908-3ca0-4786-b425-223c93b136da.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4d415c50-4d01-4df5-be44-99272aba67f2.jpg",Viral TikTok video showing a woman ‘frozen in time’ in the street is convincing everyone that the Matrix is real,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23079543/viral-tiktok-woman-frozen-street-matrix-is-real/
"A COUPLE turned a cave into a family home - but say a ""lot of hard work"" went into banishing bad smells. Bryant and Amy Gingerich built a luxury 1,500sq ft cave home for their family of five - but have to fend off dripping ceilings and an ""earthy"" atmosphere. The American couple spent around £76,000 turning a dugout in the Ohio woodlands into a glass-fronted home. The cave cabin boasts two bedrooms, each with a king-size bed,  a fully-functional kitchen, a pool table, an outdoor patio, and even multiple chandeliers hanging from the stone ceilings. The stunning renovation took only seven months, with the help of a rock specialist and an architect. But constructing a liveable space out of the Black Hand Sandstone meant the Gingerich clan had to get creative to overcome cave smells and leaks. In a video tour of the property , Mum-of-three Amy explains: ""We've had a lot of guests ask does it smell like a cave. ""We've done a lot of hard work to remove any bad smells - so we recycle the air coming in and out."" The couple's innovative solution involves using four dehumidifiers to remove moisture from the air - each one working to banish five to eight gallons of water per day. But as the home's walls are made almost entirely from the cave's naturally-occurring rock, water leakage is still a concern. Confronting a drip coming from the ceiling, dad Bryant says: ""Since I can't keep the water out, I just have to figure out what to do with it."" Bryant shows how he plans to rig a sealed pan to the ceiling to collect the water, which he will then pour through a drain in the cave's concrete flooring. The couple use several of these floor drains to keep the property ""comfortable and dry"" - calling them ""weep holes"". Despite having to battle the elements, the Gingerich family have made the space into a glamorous holiday rental . The couple share photos of the remarkable cave transformation on their Instagram , where posts show the unique woodland home's cosy fireplace and six-person hot tub. The cave also features a free-standing bathtub and is surrounded by private-hiking trails. It comes after a hermit who built a phenomenal beach cave residence was told he faced eviction by the Israeli government. Nissim Kahlon, 77, created a remarkable structure filled with tunnels, mosaics, and winding staircases out of beachside sandstone cliffs. But the country's Environmental Protection Ministry said Mr Kahlon's structure is ""illegal"" - and is endangering the Herzliya beach coastline, to the north of Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, this savvy mum built a tiny home for her whole family to enjoy - but admitted her tall father-in-law does have to duck to enter. While this £70,000 tiny home built at the bottom of a garden offers a view of the ocean - and even sits on its own wheels.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/caved-i-built-luxury-1-832328515.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/caved-i-built-luxury-1-832328508-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/caved-i-built-luxury-1-832328519.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/constantly-battling-major-issue-https-832342263.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/constantly-battling-major-issue-https-832342265.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/caved-i-built-luxury-1-832328514.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/caved-i-built-luxury-1-832328520.jpg","I built a luxury 1,500sq ft cave home for our family of 5 in seven months – but we’re constantly battling a major issue",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23079300/luxury-cave-home-major-issue/
"A HOMEOWNER'S property was ruined when builders made an expensive mistake and tore off the wrong roof. Jennifer Campbell was stunned when she returned home to see her roof a mangled mess of shingles - and the roofing company responsible refused to repair the mistake. Jennifer only found out her roof had been removed when she received a call from her son asking why she didn't mention they were getting work done on the home. She said: ""My heart sank. They were calling for rain, wind and I had a bare roof right down to the plywood. ""They didn’t just remove the shingles, they left a mess everywhere – sides of the house, backyard, debris, everything."" To make matters worse, the roof was destroyed only days before a major thunderstorm was set to roll through Oshawa, Canada . Jennifer immediately contacted police , the roofing company and her insurance company to see what could be done. Shockingly, the roofing company admitted the mistake and said they would ""give her a good deal"" on a new roof - rather than remedy their costly mistake. Jennifer said: ""I feel like it was their mistake. They weren’t invited here. They weren’t asked here.” Before the storm, the homeowner hired another company to wrap her roof. Though she may be able to file an insurance claim, Jennifer will still be £750 out of pocket due to the insurance deductible. Yet the roofing company backtracked on their former statement after local media CTV contacted them, and even offered to pay the £750 insurance deductible. They said: ""We want to be responsible for what we did. We will do her roof for free. If she wants us to do it, we can schedule it."" In the end, Jennifer went with another roofing company to replace it after her nightmare experience. Viewers of the story online were floored, and many suggested Jennifer bring a lawsuit against the roofing company. One said: ""Should have let the roofing company replace it. Now will have claim on your policy & increased rates."" Another defended Jennifer's decision: ""The roofing company said they would do it...but how can you trust them after they supposedly tried to charge her at first?"" A roofer commented: ""As a roofer, if we accidentally do this, we pay for it... hasn't happened to me but has happened to a few I know.""

"THIS is the shocking moment a dolphin attacked a swimmer and a woman off a pristine Japanese beach. The man in his 60s suffered multiple broken ribs and bites to his hands as the furious dolphin unleashed its attack. The small beach town of Mihama, Japan , has witnessed a string of dolphin attacks in recent weeks. Video taken by a beach-goer showed the swimmer attempting to head to shore as kayakers appeared to usher him through the water. He seemed to struggle when suddenly, the grey fin of a dolphin appears and drags him under the waves. The man surfaces moments later as the dolphin thrashes around, before turning back and continuing the attack. Moments later, a woman floating in a pink rubber ring was attacked by what appears to be the same dolphin. She frantically tried to swim away from the beast as it continued to nip at her flotation device. Shocked beach-goers lined the sandy shores and watched as the attacks unfolded. Another man in his 40s was bitten on the arm at the same beach that morning, and two more were injured later in the day. The incident has sparked discussion online as to what has caused the seemingly unprovoked attacks. At least six incidents have occurred off the coast of Fukui, according to local police. Some scientists have suggested that dolphins become incredibly stressed while swimming alongside humans. Others say their natural behaviour is interrupted when humans swim in close proximity, but the reason behind the recent attacks remains a mystery. One user said: ""Dolphins attacking innocent humans? What happened?"" Another observed: ""It seems that the dolphins at Suishohama have been biting since last year."" Signs have since been posted on the popular beach warning swimmers of the potentially dangerous mammals. Earlier this year, a Brit was left fighting for her life after a dolphin almost ripped off her foot in Bolivia. Claire Bye, 28, battled two life-threatening infections and needed 32 stitches after she was savaged by the pink river dolphin while swimming in a river in Santa Rosa de Yacuma. A video of the moment a dolphin attacked its trainer as shocked families as they watched on helplessly. Sundance turned violent in front of terrified children and families during the Flipper show at the Miami Seaquarium. The 23-year-old dolphin had lived at the aquarium for his entire life, but attempted to drown his trainer during the event. Dolphins aren't the only marine mammals attacking humans - Orca attacks have been on the rise on both boats and humans. Last year, a ""jealous"" killer whale body slammed a trainer who was riding a female in front of him in horrifying footage. In the sickening clip, Orky, a 12,000-pound male Orca, crushes SeaWorld trainer John Sillick under its weight as a terrified crowd watched on. In 1991, marine biology student Keltie Byrne was brutally ripped apart by killer whales in front of horrified onlookers in Canada. Keltie was the first person killed by the 5,700kg Orca when she slipped into the pool by accident. Visitors to the attraction heard her scream: ""I don't want to die."" Witnesses said Tilikum grabbed her as the two other Orcas prevented the park's staff from reaching her.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/man-60s-attacked-bitten-dolphin-832349141.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flipping-shocking-moment-enraged-dolphin-832354480.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/man-60s-attacked-bitten-dolphin-832349245.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flipping-shocking-moment-enraged-dolphin-832354425.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/man-60s-attacked-bitten-dolphin-832349139.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/man-60s-attacked-bitten-dolphin-832349140.jpg",Shocking moment enraged dolphin breaks man’s ribs and attacks victim in pink rubber ring as beasts turn on humans,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23080476/dolphin-rage-attack-japan-swimmers-bite-bones/
"DRAMATIC footage captured a Russian fighter jet crashing into the sea just off a packed tourist beach. In the latest embarrassment for Vladimir Putin , the Su-25 aircraft nosedived into the Sea of Azov near the town of Yeysk on Monday. Footage shared on social media shows the plane hurtling towards the water before it smashes into the sea with an almighty splash. A search and rescue helicopter then began circling above a crowd of swimmers on a nearby tourist beach as fears for the pilot grew. However, he had reportedly managed to eject himself from the doomed jet just in time and also plunged into the sea a short distance away. In another video, the pilot can be seen parachuting down as the Su-25 was engulfed by the waves just a matter of metres away. The impact of his hefty tumble into the ocean reportedly broke both of his legs. Local news claim he was ""unconscious"" when rescuers finally reached him and that he was taken to hospital in a ""critical condition."" The pilot reportedly abandoned the aircraft as soon as he realised it was losing altitude. According to Baza, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, as the canopy of the parachute fell, ""the lines became tangled."" It continued: ""The pilot swallowed water and almost drowned.  However, he was able to hold out until rescuers arrived. ""Now he has already been delivered to the shore, the pilot is being resuscitated."" But according to The Moscow Times , the Mash and Baza Telegram channels said that emergency crews ultimately failed to save the pilot, who reportedly could not be resuscitated on the way to the hospital after breaking his legs and getting tangled in his parachute. The waterlogged Su-25 was left ""sticking out of the shallows"" off a popular tourist beach in the Krasnodar region. The crash was caused by an “engine failure,” the Southern Military District in Rostov-on-Don said. The aircraft is believed to have run into trouble shortly after taking off from a nearby military airport. Russian military authorities said the Su-25 fighter jet crashed after taking off from the local airfield for a training flight, local media reported. A helicopter was seen in the air in the wake of the incident. Yeysk lies across the Sea of Azov from the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine 's Donetsk region. One theory was that the pilot delayed ejecting to guide the aircraft away from houses and people. A Ukrainian report said: ""Nobody shot him down."" The crash will come as another substantial blow to Putin, who is again mourning the destruction of his beloved £3billion Crimea Bridge . Two massive explosions rocked the 12-mile crossing in the early hours of Monday morning, killing a couple and injuring their teen daughter. Dramatic images show mangled and contorted metal barriers on the warped roadway, which is a major supply route for Putin's troops fighting in Ukraine . Russia immediately pointed the finger at Ukraine, with the head of the Crimean parliament Vladimir Konstantinov blaming the attack on the ""terrorist regime in Kyiv ."" Reports claim that Ukraine may have launched a kamikaze drone attack on Putin's prized bridge to disrupt its military supply route. Debris from a suspected ""jet-ski-style"" kamikaze marine drone was found near the bridge, Mash media outlet reported. It has now been claimed that Ukraine's Security Service and Naval Forces orchestrated the attack. A source told the BBC that they led the ""special operation"" that has been labelled as terrorism by furious Russian officials. The insider claimed the bridge had been targeted with surface drones , saying: ""It was difficult to reach the bridge, but in the end it was possible."" Russia's anti-terrorist committee said the strikes were carried out using unmanned drones on the water's surface. It confirmed they had already opened a criminal investigation while claiming Ukrainian ""special services"" were behind the ambush. Ukraine’s security service fuelled speculation by sharing a cryptic message seemingly referring to the damage caused to the Kerch Bridge. Mockingly repurposing a popular lullaby, the SBU wrote on Telegram: ""Nightingale, dear brother,/The bridge went ‘to sleep’ again/But once... Two!"" But Ukraine’s southern military command has suggested the incident could be a Russian ""provocation"". Army spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk claimed the explosion may have been plotted by Putin because of his reluctance to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative . The deal allowing Ukraine to continue exporting its agricultural products expired today - and Russia has now refused to renew it. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the pact brokered by Turkey and the United Nations in July last year ""has been terminated."" Crimean Wind Telegram channel said: ""The explosion of the Crimean bridge is beneficial to Putin as an excuse to break the ‘grain deal’ in order to prevent Ukraine from gaining billions of dollars from the sale of grain."" Senior Russian politician Sergei Mironov had called for his country to scrap the Black Sea agreement in response to the bridge blast.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000832381288.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000832381289.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/108ae2d8-9bab-4deb-a09e-85d4543119eb.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3675f1ba-929a-47ef-b1b7-ed3513a92739.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000735594896.jpg",Russian fighter jet crashes into sea just off packed tourist beach in latest embarrassment for Putin,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23082361/russian-fighter-jet-crashes-into-sea-latest-embarrassment-putin/
"A TOP Putin ally has called for a revenge bomb strike on Tower Bridge after today's kamikaze drone strike on a key Crimean Bridge. The Putin propagandist has pointed the finger at Britain for the attack , in the latest of instance of Russia blaming the west as it flounders in Ukraine. The head of RT propaganda media empire Margarita Simonyan - a close Putin ally - said she suspected the attack on the Crimean Bridge was carried out ""with the help of British intelligence.” She threatened: ""Does this make Tower Bridge a legitimate target ? For me, that's quite it.” Traffic was brought to a standstill due to what was initially described as an ""emergency"" on the Russian side of the bridge. Dramatic images showed mangled and contorted metal barriers on the warped roadway, which is a major supply route for Putin 's troops fighting in Ukraine . Russian foreign ministry puppet Maria Zakharova said: “The decision to attack the Crimean bridge is made by Ukrainian officials and the military, with the participation of American and British intelligence services.” She alleged that Britain and the US were “in charge of the terrorist state structure” in Ukraine. Reports claim that Ukraine may have launched the strike on Putin's prized bridge to disrupt its military supply route. Debris from a suspected ""jet-ski-style"" kamikaze marine drone was found near the bridge, Mash media outlet reported. A similar one was blown up by Russian forces in Sevastopol as it approached Putin’s warships on Sunday, according to reports. It has now been claimed that Ukraine's Security Service and Naval Forces orchestrated the attack. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said: “The world and our own experience shows that it is impossible to fight terrorists with international sanctions, intimidation or exhortations. “They only understand the language of power. Only personal and completely inhumane methods. “Therefore, it is necessary to blow up their own houses and the houses of their relatives."" Russian senator Vladimir Dzhabarov insisted Putin redouble efforts to invade Ukraine. “Ukraine must be completely cut off from the Black Sea, otherwise the threats to Crimea will be repeated again and again,” he said. “Odessa and Mykolaiv should again become Russian regions.” Another senator Andriy Klishas said ""the denazification and demilitarisation of Ukraine are very urgent tasks”. The Russian Investigative Committee was today seen scouring the blitzed bridge as they began a criminal investigation into the blast. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov made clear the grain export deal - allowing the export of Ukrainian grain - was now terminated. He claimed to know who was behind the bridge blasts - and ""are aware of the insidiousness of the Kyiv regime”. Russian couple Natalya Kulik, 36, and her husband Alexei, 40, died in their car in the bridge explosion early this morning and their 14-year-old daughter Angelina remains in hospital . Russia media has reported teen Angelina, who remains in hospital, lost her memory after the explosion and cannot remember the name of her parents. In an audio call, Angelina's aunt, who was in the car ahead of the teen and her parents said they didn't see the explosion but heard it. She said: “I heard it twice - once quietly, the second time louder.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-group-neo-nazis-arrested-831985887.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/first-pictures-damage-crimean-bridge-832274412.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/red-double-decker-london-bus-830688049.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Crimean-bridge-explosion-2-east2west-news-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1-12.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/first-pictures-damage-crimean-bridge-832274328.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/first-pictures-damage-crimean-bridge-832274505.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/first-pictures-damage-crimean-bridge-832261435.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/family-belgorod-region-killed-result-832272428.jpg",Putin ally calls for revenge bomb strike on Tower Bridge after accusing Brit spies of blitzing £2bn Crimea bridge,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23082060/putin-ally-threaten-tower-bridge-explosion-bomb-crimea-ukraine/
"SIX seaside resorts in Greece have been evacuated as raging wildfires erupt during Europe's 44C ""heat storm"". The massive blaze started in the village of Kouvaras - 30 miles from the Greek capital of Athens - forcing hundreds to flee. ""It's a difficult fire, the winds are really strong, with gusts reaching up to 37mph,"" Yannis Artopios, a firefighters' spokesman, said. ""We are in the middle of the period of fighting fires. The conditions expected will be particularly difficult and favour forest fires."" Like most of the Med, Greece has been gripped by a heatwave for the past week - with the mercury hitting 44C in some parts of the country. Seven water-bombing aircraft, four choppers and a huge crew of 150 firefighters are fighting the flames on two fronts. The team are also being helped by 30 colleagues from Romania . Footage showed helicopters racing through a massive cloud of thick smoke. A Brit holidaymaker told The Sun: ""It was scary as the fire spread very quickly. ""We were watching the fire from when we spotted the smoke initially and quickly realised we should leave the area. ""Mostly we're concerned about all the people who may have lost their home to the fire and the animals in the area."" The wildfire burnt through brush and spread south toward the Attica region and the resorts of Lagonisi, Anavyssos and Saronida - areas with thousands of seaside holiday homes. Thick smoke also blocked traffic on the roads around Kalyvia. Authorities told residents to leave the burning area - and monks were evacuated from a local monastery. A forest fire also erupted in strong winds near the Isthmus of Corinth, close to the popular beach town of Loutraki - where more evacuation orders have been put in place. More than 1,000 kids have been forced to flee a holiday camp in the area. In Athens - where temperatures hit 39C on Saturday - the Acropolis was shut during the hottest hours for three days in a row. In southern Europe , forecasters have predicted temperatures could pass 46C. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. The current bout of heat belongs to a weather system originating in North Africa - an anticyclone dubbed ""Charon"". Charon refers to a character from Ancient Greek mythology - and follows on the heels of another high pressure weather system, Cerberus, responsible for last week's sweltering heat. Holidaymakers and residents across the Mediterranean are being warned to avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine as the mercury rises in countries including Italy , Spain , France and Greece . Health officials are reminding people to stay hydrated and seek shade from the sun, with reports of people fainting in the heat. Red weather alert warnings are in place in 16 cities across Italy , including Rome. A red alert suggests the heat is high enough to pose a health risk to the whole population - not just vulnerable groups like the elderly and very young children. It comes after at least three people are believed to have died in Italy's smothering heat last week. It comes after at least three people are believed to have died in Italy's smothering heat last week. The extreme weather caused the death of a 44-year-old man who collapsed while painting a zebra crossing in Milan at 40C. He was rushed to hospital but could not be saved. And two brothers, aged six and seven, died after they jumped into a reservoir in Manfredonia in southern Italy, reportedly to cool down. The scorcher also sparked wildfires in the Spanish island of La Palma , leading to the evacuation of more than 4,000 people. The UK Met Office said Brits would not experience similar heat this summer - saying there was ""no forecast signal"" for temperatures to reach the heatwave the UK felt last year .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FIRE-1.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/112-evacuate-several-settlements-southeast-832361831.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RR-MAP-GREECE-v1-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tuesday-18-07-2023-832327856.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/house-pictured-wildfire-burns-next-832357836.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/112-evacuate-several-settlements-southeast-832367556.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/112-evacuate-several-settlements-southeast-832361821.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/people-evacuate-horses-horse-riding-832374213.jpg",Massive wildfires hit Greek seaside resorts sending terrified Brits fleeing in 44C Charon ‘heat storm’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23083297/greek-seaside-resorts-evacuated-massive-wildfires/
"THIS is the chilling moment a massive great white shark glides silently towards three unsuspecting surfers. The 10ft beast sniffed its way towards competitors in an elite surfing championship in Jeffreys Bay, South Africa - the scene of a spine-chilling attack only years earlier. Professional surfer Nathan Florence shared a video of the encounter - showing just how close the man-killer was to his fellow competitors. The drone footage shows the eerie moment the shark swims casually through a trio of the Corona Open J-Bay athletes. The great white can be seen swimming along the coast and stalking its way towards them. As it approaches them, a wave breaks over the killing machine - and one man surfs almost directly above the shark, apparently unaware of what is lurking below. The shark then moves towards the remaining surfers - and for a few tense seconds seems to tail one man as he tries to paddle away on his board. But he clearly decides the man is not on the lunch menu - because the beast then moves away, mercifully leaving the relieved surfers alone. Florence said some younger surfers first spotted the massive shark - before someone launched a drone to get a closer look. He said they tried to alert Rio Waida - one of the surfers in the water - using the drone as it was making a beeline right for his board. Florence said: ""What a crazy thing to watch we know we playing in their home but to see how easily and mellow they approach undetected is wild!"" Jeffrey’s Bay, known for its legendary surf, is notorious for shark sightings and attacks. As recently as May, a surfer suffered a shark bite on his leg. The killer creature's shock appearance at the Corona Open J-Bay comes after the competition's infamous 2015 shark encounter. The terrifying scene, caught on television, saw Aussie Mick Fanning encounter a great white two minutes into his heat - before punching the man-eater and fleeing for the shore. The three-time World Champion, then 39, later told reporters: ""I'm just lucky it wasn't my time."" But others aren't so fortunate - with 37 people in the last 25 years killed by sharks off the coast of South Africa. The latest great white killing was pizza shop owner and mum Kimon Bisogno, 39, at Plettenberg Bay in September - while on a weekend getaway with her partner and five-year-old daughter. The latest close encounter was shared to Facebook by professional US surfer Nathan Florence, 29. Nathan said: ""We saw some guys come in fast and I asked them what the deal was and they said they had seen a huge white shark. “It was close enough they could see its eyes, so we put the drone up fast to see if it was there - and sure enough it was swimming towards the world tour surfers. “We alerted people on the beach who then alerted the surfers and they all came in. ""The shark cruised on his way up the coast and everyone got on with their day."" He added: ""What a crazy chance to see a shark like that! South Africa is incredible!” Great Whites can grow up to 20 feet long and have up to 300 razor sharp teeth contained within their giant jaws. They can swim up to 35mph and normally feast on seals, sea lions and dolphins - but can mistake humans in wetsuits for their usual meal. The creatures are especially active at this time of the year, with an influx of sardine to eat. The sighting comes after a 48-year-old man was savaged at one of the most dangerous beaches in America. He is the third person to be attacked by a shark this year on Florida's Volusia County beaches, local outlet News-Journal reported. Meanwhile, experts in the world's so-called ""shark highway"" have attempted to explain a freak rise in maulings - after multiple attacks around the French island of La Réunion.","https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/pretty-crazy-saw-guys-come-832497105-1.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/pretty-crazy-saw-guys-come-832497098.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/pretty-crazy-saw-guys-come-832497047.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/pretty-crazy-saw-guys-come-832497101.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/pretty-crazy-saw-guys-come-832497036.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/pretty-crazy-saw-guys-come-832496975.jpg,https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/south-africa-eastern-cape-surfing-832354462.jpg",Chilling moment 10ft great white shark stalks THREE oblivious surfers at beach where previous competitor was mauled,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23089959/video-great-white-shark-sufer-competition/
"VLADIMIR Putin's inner circle are plotting to oust the tyrant to end his disastrous war in Ukraine, a former Russian officer warned. Igor Girkin claimed that Putin's cronies - dubbed ""The Ozeros"" - plan to sabotage Russian military operations in the wake of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's astonishing armed rebellion . Set up in 1996, the Leningrad-based group includes some of Russia's wealthiest and most powerful businessmen and bankers - with many climbing to top positions in the Kremlin. Girkin - a prominent Russian military blogger - claims the loyal circle are now plotting to topple Putin to put a stop to the war in Ukraine. He claimed they would target Russia's ministry of defence, the FSB and other major government departments - and replace Putin. Prigozhin's steaming rebellion came to an abrupt halt after he struck a deal with Putin - putting an end to a bloody 24 hours that saw Wagner forces reach within 125 miles of Moscow. But Girkin believes Prigozhin's mutiny was successful as it sparked a furious power struggle in the crumbling Kremlin - and the lightning mutiny exposed cracks in Putin's increasingly weak grip on power . At least eight Russian top brass have been detained or suspended in a mass purge as Putin's defence chief roots out the ""bad blood"" in the Kremlin. It's thought a number of Putin's inner circle knew about the coup before it happened. As Putin scrambles to maintain his rule, Girkin said his powerful inner circle now want to oust him - and bring in Wagner boss Prigozhin or Sergey Kiriyenko, Putin's chief of staff. According to Russian outlet Meduza, Kiriyenko, 60, is already trying to position himself as a possible successor to Putin. Girkin said: ""The powers within the ruling mafia are currently being redistributed as, or close to, planned by the conspirators behind the coup. ""The 'Shoigu-Vorobiev-Sobyanin Tower' has lost some of its positions although not completely demolished, and part of its influence and resources 'flows' into a group of oligarchs. ""This group, vitally interested in ending the war 'on any terms' – will not let us win in any case and will lead the president to realise the need to accept defeat and transfer supreme power to a successor nominated from this group. ""In the coming months, we should expect new campaigns aimed at 'inoculation'."" Putin has built his entire political system around loyalty - and ""The Ozeros"" rise to power and wealth on the tyrant's coat tails has raised many eyebrows over the years. Vladimir Yakunin rose to become head of state-run Russian Railways, while Yuri Kovalchuk became the head of the successful Bank Rossiya. And Andrei Fursenko is now a Kremlin aide. Yakunin described ""The Ozeros"" as ""a small group of people united by common interests and, of course, loyal to our country, wanted to do all we could for everything to turn out alright"". Tom Roberts, professor of Russian, East European & Eurasian Studies at Smith College, said ""the mutiny exposed disagreement and instability among Russia's elites, including military leadership"". ""Putin's actions also seem to confirm this, as the president has been eager to project his control of the armed forces, and to declare that national unity ensured the defeat of the mutiny,"" he added. Mikhail Rostovsky, a Russia politics expert, said Prigozhin may be a frontrunner to take over for Putin. “If Wagner is indispensable for the Russian state, then Prigozhin is indispensable for Wagner,"" Rostovsky said. ""The heads of official Russian power and law enforcement agencies are easily changed with the help of a single presidential decree. “In the case of the structure created by Yevgeny Prigozhin, everything is quite different. ""Wagner is Prigozhin, and Prigozhin is Wagner, and out of conjunction with each other, they simply cannot exist – or, if they can, then with a sharply reduced efficiency. ""Likewise, Wagner cannot exist without Russia and without the Russian state budget."" It's already been suggested by security experts that MI6 spies could help oust Putin by wooing Russian coup plotters with cash, gold Rolexes or even Wimbledon seats. It comes after leaked Pentagon docs suggested Putin was allegedly undergoing chemotherapy - and his inner circle could be using his suspected ill health to plot against him. The highly-sensitive treasure trove of US spy documents fuel the fire of speculation concerning Putin's deteriorating health. A ""top secret"" page contains the rumour that high-ranking Kremlin officials intend to ""throw"" the war in Ukraine as a ploy to ""sabotage"" Putin. The alleged plan is hinged on Putin being incapacitated while receiving chemotherapy treatment. Rumours of Putin's failing health have been swirling for months and the topic has remained a solid source of speculation within Western intelligence circles. Explosive spy documents leaked to The Sun Online appeared to confirm the Russian leader has both pancreatic cancer and early stage Parkinson's disease.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/russian-president-vladimir-putin-visits-828253311.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/l-talks-aide-andrei-fursenko-832358374.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/russian-businessman-billionaire-vladimir-yakunin-832360436.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nikolai-shamalov-one-two-wealthy-174059041.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2017-president-chairman-board-f-832359250.jpg",How Putin’s powerful inner circle dubbed ‘The Ozeros’ are plotting to topple him to finally end Ukraine war,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23081740/putin-powerful-inner-circle-ozeros-plot-topple-him/
"VLADIMIR Putin's puppet leader in a Moldovan breakaway region has been found dead by his wife. Oleg Khorzhan, 47, was found at his home in Transnistria, with reports suggesting he was stabbed or shot. Khorzhan was the leader of the Communist Party in Transnistria - a state under the guard of 1,500 Russian army ""peacekeepers"". The pro-Russian returned to politics with Moscow’s backing after being given a four-year jail term for violence against a government official. He was released eight months ago and known as a ""Moscow proxy"". Khorzhan insisted the region - self-governing since the end of Soviet times - survived ""only thanks to the help of Russia "". Russia’s Communist Party leader called for an urgent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death. Gennady Zyuganov said: ""Oleg Khorzhan has died… killed at home. We demand an investigation be immediately begun."" Pridnestrovskiy Lesnik Telegram channel said: ""Khorzhan’s wife found his corpse near a safe that was left open in one of the rooms of his house. ""The safe was empty. Did they open the safe to make it look like the murder was committed for the sake of robbery? That would be absurd."" Earlier this year opposition leader Khorzhan visited Moscow. He returned saying he had been promised ""maximum support for our republic on the part of Russia"" by top pro-Putin politicians. Earlier this year, Transnistria authorities claimed to have stopped an assassination attempt on the region’s president - Vadim Krasnoselsky, which they alleged was orchestrated by the secret service in Ukraine . Ukraine denied the accusation, calling it ""a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlin"". Moldova has accused Russia of using the Transnistria breakaway state in its bid to destabilise the country. Some experts believe Putin is eyeing up an invasion of Moldova - a former part of the old Soviet Union - as he seeks to build a new empire. It comes after a Russian naval captain was shot dead after a hitman tracked him down using a popular fitness app. Stanislav Rzhitsky - who had recently worked as a mobilisation official for Putin’s war against Ukraine - was shot four times as he ran near the Olympus Arena in Krasnodar city. He was struck in the back and chest, with seven bullets fired from a Makarov pistol.

"THIS 65-year-old Brazilian mayor married a 16-year-old schoolgirl and has taken his bride on a dream honeymoon in the Caribbean. Kauane Camargo and her wrinkled hubby Hissam Dehaini are holidaying in Aruba , but the dream getaway will end soon as she has to return to school. City Hall officials say Dehani is on holiday for a month - just in time for his bride to return to school when the new term begins in August. The couple sparked a huge scandal in Araucaria, in the Brazilian state of Parana, when they married on April 12. Some reports say Kauane turned 16 only days before her marriage ceremony to the senior citizen. Dehain said: ""We are happy. She does me good, and I do her good, and together we are not doing anyone any harm."" Kauane shared the snaps from the couple's luxury resort getaway, showing the couple apparently blissfully happy. One photo shows the couple arm in arm at the beach, while another shows them puckering up for a kiss. But bride Kauane has defended her husband and slammed trolls online. She said: ""What matters, honestly... It's just that we don't care!"" Within days of the wedding, two of Kauane's relatives were given high-paying jobs in on the mayor's city hall staff. Her 36-year-old mother Marilene Rode was made the new Municipal Secretary of Culture and Tourism. And the bride's aunt Elizangela Rode was appointed Secretary General Director at City Hall. The new First Lady of Araucaria - who is still in high school - is a local beauty queen. Three-time wed Dehain made his multi-million-pound fortune as a businessman. Dehaini, who is reportedly worth £2.2 million, was once seized over drug charges. In Brazil , marrying at 16 is legal with parental permission, and the country is reportedly the fifth biggest in the world for underage marriages. Hissam Hussein Dehaini, a father to 16 children, has been married six times, tying the knot for the first time in 1980, G1 learned.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hissaim-hussein-dehaini-poses-kauane-832361461.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hissaim-hussein-dehaini-poses-kauane-832361556.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hissaim-hussein-dehaini-kisses-kauane-832361562.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mayor-araucaria-hissan-hussein-dehaini-832361528.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mayor-araucaria-hissan-hussein-dehaini-832361546.jpg",I’m a mayor aged 65 and just married a 16-year-old… we’re off on honeymoon but she’ll be back in school when we get home,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23083127/mayor-married-student-honeymoon-school-holidays/
"TOURISTS are facing a red alert weather warning in Majorca as a heatwave scorches Southern Europe. The Spanish resort island is expecting temperatures of up to 43C with tomorrow set to be the hottest day of the year so far. Spain's Met Office issued the red alert, warning of ""extreme risk"" to health - especially for the elderly, young babies and those with existing illnesses. Experts urged tourists and locals to stay hydrated and remain in the shade as a ""heat storm"" dubbed Charon hits resorts around the Med. Holidaymakers are being told to avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine as the mercury rises in countries including Spain, Italy, France, Croatia and Greece. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. Health officials are reminding people to stay hydrated and seek shade from the sun, with reports of tourists fainting in the heat in Rome and Athens. And red weather alert warnings are in place in 16 cities across Italy, including Rome - where temperatures are likely to hit 43C. A red alert suggests the heat is high enough to pose a health risk to the whole population - not just vulnerable groups like the elderly and very young children. It comes after at least three people are believed to have died in Italy's smothering heat last week. The extreme weather caused the death of a 44-year-old man who collapsed while painting a zebra crossing in Milan at 40C. He was rushed to hospital but could not be saved. And two brothers, aged six and seven, died after they jumped into a reservoir in Manfredonia in southern Italy, reportedly to cool down. Meanwhile wildfires erupted in the Spanish island of La Palma , leading to the evacuation of more than 4,000 people. A wildfire has also been reported in the Kouvaras area in Attica, southern Greece, with the Greek civil service reporting up to 150 firefighters are attempting to control the blaze. The latest bout of heat belongs to a weather system originating in North Africa - an anticyclone dubbed Charon. It is named after a character from Ancient Greek mythology - and follows on the heels of another high pressure weather system, Cerberus, responsible for last week's sweltering heat. Weather forecasters have warned temperatures could climb above 48C on the Italian islands of Sardinia and Siciily, 45C in Turkey and 44C in Spain. But the UK Met Office said Brits would not experience similar heat this summer, saying there was ""no forecast signal"" for temperatures to match the heatwave the UK felt last year .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-children-demand-water-shower-832376390.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-scorching-weather-gripped-three-832366330.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tuesday-18-07-2023-832327856.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-southern-europe-experiencing-major-832356394.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/250-gbp-print-fees-agreed-832374321.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ce0c0bfe-28e3-4053-a10c-0a65e1f78ffb.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/view-burned-cars-tijarafe-forest-832332588.jpg",Urgent Spain holiday warning over ‘extreme risk’ alert for popular resort as 43C Charon ‘heat storm’ hits island,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23082411/urgent-warning-silent-killer-charon/
"A CHEF has told how he gave up his kitchen job to pursue his side-hustle and now rakes in £100,000 a year. Sean Audet, 30, from Winnipeg, Canada says he stumbled on his new role by accident before taking it on full-time back in 2020. The business began back in 2016 when Sean, who was running a restaurant two nights a week while also working in culinary research at a college, had a light bulb moment. While taking pictures of his student’s food he realised that he could also do this for restaurants to help advertises their businesses. Using the college’s cameras and lights he began to take on clients by staging and snapping pictures of their grub. By 2020 he made enough money to buy his own equipment - and took the chance to leave his 9-5 and go freelance. He told CNBC : “Spending almost a decade in fine dining, plating beautiful food, helped me segue into this niche. “It really gave me a leg up, and I started booking bigger clients almost immediately.” Two years later, in 2022, Audet brought in roughly £102,400. He said: “Every once in a while, I’ll stumble upon something that gets me super excited. “With no prompting, I’ll just start working an extra 12 to 14 hours a day on something that interests me. “When that happens, I feel like you have to pay attention.” It comes after a teacher told how he makes an extra £300 a week with his relaxing side hustle - despite his busy schedule. Faisal Khan, a secondary school maths and science teacher, is passionate about educating the next generation. But the dad-of-four now earns a flexible second income which fits into his busy life. Faisal said he always enjoyed driving as a way to “de-stress”, because it relaxes him. He has now turned his hobby into a handy side-hustle which nets him hundreds of pounds extra per month. He joined FREENOW around two years ago and has been able to make extra cash each month as a taxi driver.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/male-photographer-laptop-tree-hut-832387277.jpg,I gave up my 9-5 job to pursue my side-hustle & now I rake in £100k a YEAR… I stumbled on the role by accident,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23085442/gave-up-job-pursue-my-side-hustle/
"THE woman who was once dubbed the world’s hottest weather girl now has a very different career. Yanet Garcia found fame as a meteorologist doing the weather forecast for Televisa Monterrey in Nuevo León, Mexico , after a short yet fairly successful career as a model. Playboy gave her the title, saying she “encourages people to watch the weather forecast”. For a while she was wildly popular, attracting huge audiences to the local news programme. Yanet was not just a big attraction in Mexico but also worldwide as clips from her weather segments were posted on YouTube , building up a vast army of followers. She also forged something of a minor acting career, appearing in 2017’s Sharknado 5: Global Swarming and Bellezonismo in 2019. The now 33-year-old worked for the TV station from 2013 to 2019 before quitting and then moving to the US. Having left Televisa Monterrey, she registered herself as a personal trainer and launched her own fitness app called FitPlan. She also announced she was joining OnlyFans , having built up a huge following on YouTube and Instagram , where she has some 14.8million followers. Fans of the former weather presenter now pay £15 ($20) a month for her OnlyFans content, making sure she is known as “The Mexican Weather Girl,” the moniker she gained while appearing on TV. Yanet's previously been forced to deny rumours that she's had bum implants , insisting that her figure is the result of years of hard work in the gym. Previously, Yanet dated YouTuber Doug Censor Martin, otherwise known as FaZe Censor. He is thought to have dumped her to spend more time on Call of Duty in 2018. She also reportedly dated former American football player now life-guru Lewis Howes in 2021. Yanet made a name for herself on the world sporting stage when she was kicked in the bum on Mexican TV for ""good luck"" in Mexico's World Cup 2018 opener.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pictures-tkaen-yanet-garcia-instagram-422384350.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c25fe46a-690b-4329-8d67-84458ae5f5cc.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yanet-garcia-attends-gq-mexico-832387919.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yanet-garcia-832387950.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yanet-garcia-832387953.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/yanet-garcia-poses-pictures-overboard-832387931.jpg","I was the ‘world’s hottest weather girl’ – now I’ve got a surprising new career, says Yanet Garcia",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23085480/worlds-hottest-weather-girl-yanet-garcia-personal-trainer/
"A WOMAN has told how she was hit by a METEORITE while having coffee with a pal. The space rock blew through the roof before landing on the French woman’s rib - leaving experts shocked. The unnamed woman was left with bruising after being hit by the meteorite on July 6 in Schirmeck. She told local newspaper Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace: “I heard a big ‘poom’ coming from the roof next to us. “In the second that followed, I felt a shock on the ribs. I thought it was an animal, a bat. “We thought it was a piece of cement, the one we apply to the ridge tiles, but it didn't have the colour.” She took the rock – weighing around 50g - to a geologist Dr Thierry Rebmann who explained it is a meteorite made up of iron and silicon. Meteorites, not to be confused with meteors, are known as solid pieces of debris which typically come from the asteroid belt which orbits between Mars and Jupiter. The debris in meteorites typically comes from a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid. Dr Rebmann told France Bleu Alsace: “Finding a meteor is already uncommon, but to be in direct contact and have it fall on you, that is astronomically rare. “We haven't seen that in decades in this region.” The major difference between meteorites and meteors is that meteors burn up before reaching the ground while meteorites can strike the Earth . Meteorites typically come towards Earth after a collision within the asteroid belt sends chunks flying towards us. Larger ones that end up hitting the moon or Mars have also been known to send smaller chunks our way. According to New Scientist , in 1911, a 40-kilogram boulder from Mars killed a dog in Egypt and then a boy in 1992 was hit but not seriously injured by a small meteorite. In 2021, a Canadian woman was nearly hit in the head with a meteorite that landed on her pillow after it smashed through her roof.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/meteor-glowing-enters-earths-atmosphere-783350629.jpg,I was hit by a METEORITE while having coffee with a pal – it crashed into a roof & landed in my ribs,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23085901/hit-by-meteorite-while-having-coffee-with-pal/
"ECO yobs have trashed a £240million superyacht owned by a Walmart heiress after it docked in Ibiza. Police seized the two activists from Futuro Vegetal on July 16 after they used adapted fire extinguishers to spray the 360-foot yacht - owned by billionaire Nancy Walton Laurie - with paint. Shocking video footage of the vandalism shows the stern of the vessel - named Kaos - being spattered with red and black paint as deckhands try to hose it off. The activists then held up a sign saying ""You Consume Others Suffer"" before they can been seen being spoken to by a security guard. The yacht can finally be seen sailing out of the harbour with its stern still badly stained. The incident was the latest in a series of Europe-wide stunts where eco-activists try to disrupt major sporting events and target the rich and powerful. A second piece of footage shows the two protesters holding up the sign and demanding change, with the first activist saying: ""The Mediterranean Sea is a human cemetery."" Nancy bought the Kaos superyacht from the Qatari royal family in 2019. It was built by Oceanco, the same company which made Jeff Bezos’ £400m superyacht. Kaos reportedly costs between £17.17 and £25.76m in maintenance alone every year. It weighs 4,523 tonnes and was built in the Netherlands in 2017 and was previously known under the name 'Jubilee'. In 2020, Nancy had it refitted and redesigned by British designer Reymond Langton. Kaos has four decks and can house 31 guests in 16 cabins as well as 45 crew members in 24 cabins. There are four VIP suites, while most of the standard suites come with en suite bathrooms. Nancy, 72, is reportedly worth £6.64billion ($8.7bn), according to Forbes, after inheriting a stake in Walmart from her dad Bud Walton, co-founder of the American chain of hypermarkets. The first-ever Walmart store opened in July 1962 in Arkansas , and the heirs own around 50 percent of the stock collectively. In May this year, the superyacht was spotted cruising into the Thames before docking in London .","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-per-cent-world-population-832343562.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-superyacht-kaos-seen-arriving-819846548.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6f8b4a0c-ea55-4570-b1a2-f922af4d63af.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-per-cent-world-population-832343672.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-per-cent-world-population-832343660.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9c10819d-86c0-4066-a355-b0af00db49ef.jpg",Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie’s £240m superyacht trashed by eco yobs in outrageous stunt after it docks in Ibiza,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23085889/walmart-heiresss-superyacht-vandalised-paint-eco-protesters-ibiza/
"COPS frantically searching for a missing French toddler are probing a horrifying new theory. Little two-year-old Emile Soleil vanished without a trace from the village of Le Vernet in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence on July 8. Emile’s grandparents alerted the authorities about 5.15pm local time sparking a massive search for the missing boy. But officials called off the search on Thursday as ""no sign"" of Emile was found in the small hamlet, which is home to about two dozen people. Now cops are investigating a theory that the young lad may have been hit by a combine harvester. A farmer from the village told BFMTV: “Sometimes we find deer. “The little one may have ended up in the tall grass and been hit by a farm machine. That would be terrible.” Emile, who is originally from Bouches-du-Rhône near Marseille , is described as 3ft tall with brown eyes and blonde hair . The day he disappeared he was wearing a yellow top, white shorts with a green pattern, and hiking shoes. He was last seen by two people when he left his grandparents' home - but they said they ""lost sight of him"". The boy's disappearance has sparked multiple theories regarding his whereabouts - with several questions remaining unanswered. The absence of the boy's parents from the public eye has fuelled speculation regarding the possibility of the family's involvement in the boy's disappearance. Information has also emerged about their background. A police source said: ""A family reunion was taking place, with several uncles and aunts of the child, of all ages, including some minors. ""Emile was seen on Saturday morning, along with other children."" A local told French newspaper Le Figaro there was ""some bickering between the children"" a few days before Emile's disappearance. Asked whether it is possible for the boy's family to be somehow involved in his disappearance, a source close to the investigation told La Depeche that it is a theory police are exploring among others. The mayor of Le Vernet Francois Balique said their best hope is for the boy to have been kidnapped. Speaking to Le Figaro, Francois Balique said: ""Our only hope now is that he’s been taken and is alive. It’s the last thing we can hope for and it’s already terrible. ""We could consider that someone wanting to cause harm to a child passed by the area, that he saw this beautiful little boy and took him away. He couldn’t survive alone in the wild, that’s for sure. ""And since little Emile’s body has not been found, it means that he was not alone at the time. ""We can consider a car accident in which the driver would have panicked and concealed the body. That’s one hypothesis.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-866.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-867.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-868.png,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-french-southern-alps-village-830839462-1.jpg","Cops searching for missing Emile, two, probe NEW theory in desperate bid to find him – as key questions remain",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23086010/cops-searching-missing-emile-probe-new-theory/
"A HERMIT has told how he built a tiny cave home in a remote mountain after becoming sick of people hassling him. Panta Petrovic , 72, moved to his tiny Serbian cave in the mountains to avoid society two decades ago. Before this, he had been living the “hectic” life of a labourer in the nearby town of Pirot. However, after gradually isolating himself, he realised it was how he wanted to live - and he moved himself to the cliff. His tiny cave home now is only accessible by a steep climb. He told AFP: ""I was not free in the city. There is always someone in your way – you either argue with your wife, neighbours , or the police . ""Here, nobody is hassling me.” Panta had shared his home with goats, chickens, 30 cats and dogs and his favourite - an adult wild boar named Mara. But last year he was devasted when his animals were attacked and killed by a pack of wolves . He said: “There must have been five, six of them. “I managed to crawl through the hole (in the cave), took an axe and waited. There was no way out, that hole saved me.” Now he keeps his animals in a shack in the outskirts of town - and makes pilgrimages down the cliff to take care of them. Petrovic receives welfare, but also relies on donations for food and supplies for the animals. When it comes to feeding himself, he mainly lives off foraged mushrooms and fish he catches from a nearby river. Before isolating, he donated all his money to the community by funding the construction of three small bridges in the town. He explained: ""Money is cursed, it spoils people. I think nothing can corrupt a human like money."" Panta made the news worldwide back in 2020 when he left his cave to get the Covid vaccine. At the time he said: “I want to get all three doses, including the extra one. I urge every citizen to get vaccinated, every single one of them.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/twenty-years-ago-panta-petrovic-832397090-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/twenty-years-ago-panta-petrovic-832397097.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/twenty-years-ago-panta-petrovic-832397093.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/twenty-years-ago-panta-petrovic-832397088.jpg",I was sick of people hassling me so I built a tiny CAVE home in remote mountains – I loved my life before a tragic twist,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23086418/tiny-cave-home-in-remote-mountains/
"ADRIFT on the Pacific Ocean with only his dog Bella for company, ­real-life castaway Tim Shaddock seemed done for. For two months he was at the mercy of the currents, surviving aboard his storm-battered catamaran on just raw fish and rainwater. Then last week, thanks to a chance sighting by a trawler crew, a gaunt, shaggy-bearded Tim and his beloved pet were hauled to safety. Like Tom Hanks ’ character Chuck Noland from hit Hollywood movie Cast Away, he was dangerously malnourished and had badly weather-beaten skin. Bella wagged her tail excitedly as the trawler crew filmed the rescue. Her companionship is credited with having helped Tim cling to life. Now “stable and very well”, Aussie Tim, 51, was filmed telling rescuers: “I have been through a very difficult ordeal. “I’m just needing rest and good food. “Otherwise I’m in very good health.” Bella also seems well. Former IT specialist Tim, from Sydney , had set out in April from La Paz, Mexico , on a 3,728-mile voyage to French Polynesia. But weeks into the challenge, his vessel was damaged in a storm that downed its electronic and navigation systems. Sheltered by a canopy from the beating sun, cancer survivor Tim fished for survival as his hair and beard grew wild. His filthy, thread-bare clothing included two hats he wore at the same time to ward off sunstroke. Then came something that must have seemed like a mirage. A helicopter from the tuna ship hovered over his catamaran — and the pilot radioed to the vessel for help. Tim and Bella were then lifted aboard. It was like a scene from Cast Away, where Chuck survives an aircraft crash into the Pacific and, clinging to a raft, washes up on an uninhabited island. A latter-day Robinson Crusoe, after four harrowing years he is then rescued by a passing cargo ship. Tim, whose doctor says he has “normal vital signs”, is now returning to Mexico with the trawler. But his look is in sharp contrast to photos from earlier in his life. In one image, he is clean-shaven and heavyset, in an ironed blue shirt. In the early 2000s, Tim was diagnosed with stage-four bowel cancer , and he turned to a “holistic approach to healing instead of the conventional road of treatment”. He said: “When my health was at a critical stage, it involved a lot of fasting, juicing and smoothies. ""I recall spending over three months living just on green vegetable juice.” That raw-food diet stood him in good stead adrift on the Pacific, as he survived eating uncooked fish. Ocean survival expert Professor Mike Tipton hailed Tim’s rescue as a “needle in a haystack” marvel. He said: “People need to appreciate how small the boat is and how vast the Pacific is. “The chances of someone being found are pretty slim.” The professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth added that Tim’s survival was a “combination of luck and skill”. He cited his foresight in using a sun canopy, explaining that “the last thing you want when in danger of becoming dehydrated is to be sweating”. He also said Bella “may well have made the difference”, adding: “You’re living very much from day to day. “You have to have a very positive mental attitude to get through this kind of ordeal and not give up.” He added that Tim — who has now eaten some small meals on the trawler — will need to wean himself back on to a normal diet. He said: “It has to be a slow return.” At home in Australia, Tim’s mum Jan Shaddock said: “He sent a voice message through the tuna boat’s captain. “He was elated he was safe. “I’ve been to church to give thanks.” She added that she “can’t wait” to see her son, but will not stop him trying more voyages. She said: “You can’t live their lives for them.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-shaddock-left-mexico-aiming-832380255.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-shaddock-left-mexico-aiming-832345926.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tim-shaddock-832378904.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/twine-mess-tom-marooned-chuck-2412210.jpg","I was lost at sea for 2 months & lived on raw fish but my dog Bella saved my life, says real-life castaway Tim Shaddock",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23085670/lost-at-sea-two-months-dog-saved-life/
"TRAVELLERS were left fuming when a nightmare passenger caused their plane to be diverted after he had a meltdown over being served the wrong meal - but they got their revenge. Video shows the man berating staff on the United Airlines flight headed from Houston to Amsterdam before they were forced to land Chicago three hours after take off. Passengers were raging at his antics, but they got their sweet revenge when the man was escorted away by cops when they finally landed. The man, dressed in a black and white shirt is seen standing up shouting “f**k you” at staff while his fellow passengers watch on in shock. He went on: “I've been a United flyer for a long time. I paid £1,000 bucks for my way. “I don't want to comply with anything because...whenever the government and the regulations tell me, that's where I need to be. “You're a d**che. You know it though. You know you're a d**che.” Another passenger, who posted the clip on TikTok , said: “We got to stop in Chicago to let this super nice guy off the plane. “He continued to laugh and antagonize the United crew after these, and they handled it with such calm!” A second video shows the man being confronted by police after he was kicked off the plane in Chicago.

"BRITISH tourists in Benidorm have been warned they are ""risking their health with beach drinks"" as a heatwave scorches Southern Europe. Holidaymakers have been warned of unauthorised vendors selling cocktails that may contain E-Coli bacteria and traces of human faeces on the city's sandbanks. Dubbed ""mojiteros"", the sellers tend to handle the products with their hands in car boots or on the floor, with little to no sanitary control, according to Cristina Escoda, a government spokesperson. The drinks are usually half the price of the ones sold at beach-front bars but tourists risk falling ill by consuming the cocktails . Police surveillance on the popular beaches have ramped up following the return of the vendors with the PSOE party claiming the areas are once again ""infested"" by the illegal sellers. Escoda told a Spanish local news outlet that the presence of these vendor's on Benidorm's beaches has ""increased"" since the beginning of summer. ""Taking a simple walk, you can see an incessant trickle of people carrying out these illegal activities with total normality,"" she said. ""This not only affects the image we offer to tourists but also seriously harms the city's hospitality sector."" And she warned: ""It can put the health of consumers at risk"". Escoda called on the People's Party government team to act urgently and implement measures to tackle the growing problem. She said: ""We know that it is complicated but part of the solution must involve both increasing the police presence and reinforcing the information and awareness campaigns for residents and tourists."" Last month holiday advice was also issued to tourists about buying drinks from the Spanish sellers as they could face a massive fine if cops catch them buying the dodgy street liquor. Benidorm city council says it has already reinforced police measures on the city's sandbanks during the summer period, significantly increasing the number of troops assigned to the surveillance of the beaches. ""In the busiest hours, there are 16 officers,"" said a spokesperson. ""It is carried out not only on the beach and on the promenades but also from the water and from the air thanks to the zodiac and drone service."" This comes as Spain's Met Office issued a red alert , warning of ""extreme risk"" to health to those holidaying in Majorca as the Charon heatwave continues to hit. The Spanish party island, just an hour away from Benidorm by plane, is expecting temperatures of up to 43C today - the hottest day of the year so far. Experts urged tourists and locals to stay hydrated, remain in the shade and avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine as the mercury rises in countries including Spain, Italy, France, Croatia and Greece. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The extreme weather has already caused the death of at least three people in Italy as eight red alert warnings have come into force across the country.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-holidaymakers-braving-heatwave-benidorm-831853139.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/holiday-warning-never-buy-drinks-823799289.jpg",Holiday warning for Brit tourists ‘risking health with beach drinks’ as Europe swelters in Charon heatwave,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23088652/holiday-warning-brit-tourists-beach-drinks-charon-heatwave/
"A US SOLDIER has reportedly been arrested by North Korea after crossing the heavily fortified border. He is said to have ventured into Kim Jong-un 's dictatorship during an organised visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Although information on the man's arrest is scarce, it is believed he is currently in custody in North Korea . South Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo identified the man as an American soldier - named as Private Travis King. The US Army has not yet confirmed if one of its personnel is missing. Korea's United Nations command announced the news of his detention on Tuesday. It said it is working tirelessly with the North's military to ""resolve"" the situation. A Twitter post read: ""A US National on a JSA orientation tour crossed, without authorization, the Military Demarcation Line into the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). ""We believe he is currently in DPRK custody and are working with our KPA counterparts to resolve this incident."" Korean news outlet TV Chosun reported that the UN Command was conducting a general tour of the Joint Security Area, also known as Panmunjom . It is where the infamous ""Bridge of No Return"" is located and where numerous prisoner swaps have taken place. Choi Gi-il, a professor of military studies at Sangji University told AFP: ""Panmunjom is the most likely site this American chose to cross into North Korea because it's the only location one could attempt such a move out of the whole JSA tour."" This neutral zone acts as a meeting point for the two opposing nations and is where negotiations take place between the leaders. But it hasn't stopped Kim Jong-un from trying to assert his authority, as he ordered his troops to fire shots towards a South Korean guard post in May 2020. Local news claimed military sources have said the US soldier somehow slipped past armed guards at 3.27pm local time and infiltrated North Korea. It added that the man did not return back to the South. An eyewitness claimed they saw him let out ""a loud 'ha ha ha' before he ran in between some buildings in the direction of the North Korean border."" They told CBS News they initially thought it was a ""bad joke"" but realised the severity of the incident when the man did not return. The bystander said: ""Then everybody reacted and things got crazy."" The tour group were reportedly then quickly ushered back to the Freedom House to provide statements and taken to their bus. The witness added: ""It actually hit me quite hard. It was on the way back in the bus, and we got to one of the checkpoints.... Someone said we were 43 going in and 42 coming back."" The two Koreas are divided by the world's most heavily armed border known as the Demilitarized Zone, which was established in 1953. It is estimated two million mines are peppered inside and close to the 248-kilometre-long and four-kilometre-wide border barrier. The DMZ is also flanked by barbed wire fences, tank traps and crowds of combat troops on both sides. The soldiers aren't scared to use their weapons either - and are known to blast those trying to defect across the border . In July last year, chilling images captured two North Korean defectors being dragged back over the border by guards. Those who have survived the consequences of trying to escape told how they were tortured and outcast, while living in fear they remain on Kim Jong Un's ""target list."" North Korea hastily closed its borders at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and has still not reopened them. Security measures on its side of the Joint Security Area became more lax as a result - but Kim Jong-un is not expected to take the soldier's antics lightly. Retired US Army Lt. Col. Steve Tharp, who worked in the JSA area, said it is unclear how the tyrant will react as there is ""so little data out there"" about incidents such as this. He told NK News: ""This is the first contact since Covid... We don't know what they're thinking."" Despite being a bleak no man's land, it is also a major attraction for tourists who manage to gain access to special but short tours. They are led by expert guides who take groups to explore Imjingak Park, the DMZ Theatrr, the Third Infiltration Tunnel and other landmarks. Donald Trump previously made history as the first US President to set foot in North Korea when he visited the border in 2019 . He told reporters that it was ""a great honour"" to be welcomed by the dictator and even hinted that he planned to return the favour. It comes as the US deployed a nuclear-armed submarine to North Korea's doorstep for the first time in 40 years. Seoul confirmed the 18,750-tonne USS Kentucky entered a key naval base in Busan - 320 kilometres southeast of the capital. The 170-metre long USS Kentucky is one of the largest nuke-capable ballistic missile submarines in the world - and can carry more than 20 Trident-II ballistic missiles. Washington and South Korea have ramped up defence talks after Kim Jong-un fired his most powerful ballistic missile yet last week. During Tuesday's meeting, the two nations agreed to share information, establish a secure comms network - and coordinate and plan for a possible North Korean nuclear attack.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/joint-security-area-dmz-managed-832516639.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000703090621.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/north-korean-leader-kim-jong-766071075.jpg","US soldier ‘arrested by North Korea’ after crossing the heavily fortified DMZ border checkpoint, UN says",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23091146/us-citizen-arrested-north-korea-crossing-border-visiting-dmz/
"SCORCHING temperatures and raging wildfires are sweeping Europe as the heat is expected to continue for weeks. Foreign Office officials have warned Brits heading to the continent to take care due to the possible health risks posed by ""extreme"" heat in Spain and Greece. Forecasters from the United Nations' weather agency the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) have warned that the hot weather is expected to persist into the start of August. Wildfires have raged in Spain , Greece , Italy, Switzerland and Turkey , while France , Germany and Poland also prepare for scorching conditions. Meteorologists said the mercury will soar up to 46C across southern Europe for several days, leaving Brits heading abroad considering how to dodge the sun. The temperatures are expected to hit their peak this afternoon in Sardinia, Italy. WMO forecasters also revealed the next two weeks will continue to deliver doses of intense heat. It said the heat storm is likely to continue to August in some spots, meaning it is going to be a long, hot, and potentially dangerous summer . WMO boss Professor Petteri Taalas warned the ""extreme weather"" is having a ""major impact on human health, ecosystems, economies, agriculture, energy and water supplies"". The UN agency said the weather - which is refusing to relent even overnight - brings an increased risk of heart attacks and deaths. And there is a slew of severe weather warnings from national weather agencies in place across Europe. Tourists have been thrown into turmoil after countries issued alerts at the height of the holiday season. UK officials urged Brits to check before they travel, citing ""extreme"" weather warnings in Spain and Greece. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it will raise temperatures around the world, and the effect is likely to continue for the rest of the year. Locals and visitors alike have been urged to stay hydrated across Europe as the ""heat storm"" dubbed Charon hits resorts around the Mediterranean. Are you near one of the wildfire areas? Email alikikraterou@thesun.co.uk or WhatsApp 07741005808 if you have any information. The anticyclone is named after the Greek mythological boatman who ferries souls to the underworld. Temperatures are already in their mid to high 20s in some parts of Europe this morning, leaving some power grids unable to cope with the demand for air conditioning. Weather alerts have been issued for at least 16 cities in Italy as the nation braces for scorching conditions . Locals complained they are struggling to work, eat or sleep due to the stifling heat, while tourists are fainting from the feverish temps. Holidaymakers in Rome have been forced to flock to the Trevi Fountain for a brief moment of relief from the suffocating streets. A legion of police officers has been stationed at the city landmark to stop any daring travellers from diving in to cool down. The city is set to be engulfed by temperatures of up to 43C. Power outages hit parts of Rome yesterday as electricity grids struggle to keep up with the demand for industrial-size fans and air-con. The extreme weather caused the death of a 44-year-old man who collapsed while painting a zebra crossing in Milan at 40C. Italy's health minister Orazio Schillaci has urged people to swerve tourist hotspots for their own safety as the deadly heat continues. Spain will also bare the burden of the blistering heat today, with forecasters expecting the mercury to boom to 44C in the Guadalquivir Valley near Seville. Those in Majorca are set to endure temperatures to up to 43C , making it the hottest day of the year so far on the party island. The country's Met Office has issued a red alert weather warning of an ""extreme risk"" to health - especially for the elderly, young babies and those with existing illnesses. The scorching conditions across Spain have only been exacerbated by the raging wildfires that continue to rip through La Palma . The popular island has been engulfed by the roaring flames since Saturday - and they show no sign of slowing down. Infernos have engulfed the north of the island, forcing a whopping 4,000 people to evacuate their homes and holiday pads. The Canary Islands Government issued a Level 2 emergency alert after over 11,300 acres of woodland were scorched. More than 300 firefighters, nine water-carrying helicopters and two planes are still battling to control the unruly wildfires. Spain's Aemet weather agency said the heatwave this week ""will affect a large part of the countries bordering the Mediterranean"". The agency says it expects temperatures to drop sometime on Wednesday. Greece has faced a similar struggle amid the sizzling heatwave , as temperatures continue to climb to terrifying heights across the nation. The mercury is expected to rise to 43C in Athens over the weekend, with weather watchers warning it is unlikely to ease anytime soon. Officials fear further wildfires like the two that are already tearing through the country could wreak havoc. More than a thousand children were evacuated from a summer camp in the coastal town of Loutraki as the fires grew worryingly close. Homes in Athens have been overcome by flames, while swathes of pine forests have been decimated as strong winds pushed the blazes toward the south coast of Attica. Highways have been closed, seaside resorts abandoned and holiday homes deserted as the wildfires continue to roar. The idyllic mountains of Switzerland have also fallen victim to wildfires in wake of the extreme heat sweeping Europe. Fires broke out following days of hot, dry and windy conditions across the region. Several villages were evacuated last night as forest fires spread throughout the canton of Valais in terrifying scenes. More than 200 firefighters are battling to dampen the flames although it is currently continuing to burn. The army , police and other agencies have been called in to help conquer the blaze ripping through towns close to the Italian border. Locals have also been warned of rockfalls as the scorching heat wreaks havoc on the environment as well as infrastructure. Researchers from the University of Oxford revealed Switzerland was one of the European nations who are ""dangerously unprepared"" for punishing heatwaves. The country is set to see another scorching week before thunderstorms roll in over the weekend - but highs of 32C will continue.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-forest-fire-broke-bitsch-832506610.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-forest-fire-broke-bitsch-832507438.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-relentless-heatwave-wildfires-scorched-832507792.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefighter-teams-conduct-extinguishing-works-832404254.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-monte-bonifato-continues-burning-832510989.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/h125-helicopter-carries-water-extinguish-832504669.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-scorching-weather-gripped-three-832366009.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epa10751399-tourists-use-fans-protect-832352307.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/e9ad486c-5a3e-4cba-a15c-19c00e681fca.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-heatwave-italy-unforgiving-heat-832368650.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/burnt-house-seen-following-wildfire-832480947-1.jpg",Europe heat storm may continue for weeks as fires erupt in tourist hotspots and Brits warned of 46C Charon scorcher,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23087899/europe-heat-storm-may-continue-weeks-fires-erupt-charon/
"AMERICA has deployed a nuke-armed submarine to North Korea's doorstep for the first time in 40 years amid fears of a nuclear war. Washington and South Korea have ramped up defence talks after Kim Jong-un fired his most powerful ballistic missile yet last week. The allies are staging joint war drills with advanced stealth jets and US strategic assets as tensions mount in the region. And for the first time since the 1980s, a US nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine arrived in South Korea on Tuesday. Seoul confirmed the 18,750-tonne USS Kentucky entered a key naval base in Busan - 320 kilometres southeast of Seoul. The 170-metre long USS Kentucky is one of the largest nuke-capable ballistic missile submarines in the world - and can carry more than 20 Trident-II ballistic missiles. Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup said the deployment demonstrates a united force against Kim Jong-un. ""To North Korea , it shows the overwhelming capabilities and posture of the alliance, while it demonstrates the solid combined defence posture of South Korea and the United States to our people and the international community,"" he said. The move came as the US and South Korea held their first meeting of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) in Seoul - aimed at ""bolstering nuclear deterrence against North Korea"". White House Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell told reporters: ""As we speak, an American nuclear submarine is making port in Busan today. ""That's the first visit of an American nuclear submarine in decades."" The last time Washington deployed a nuclear-capable submarine to South Korea was in 1981. Washington announced it would be deploying the sub back in April. The US has also vowed to deploy more assets to South Korea to deter North Korea - such as aircraft carriers, submarines and long-range bombers. On Sunday, Japan , South Korea and the US held joint navy war drills in a show of force against North Korea. A South Korean naval officer said the exercise focused on detecting and tracking a computer-simulated ballistic target . It came after North Korea fired its most powerful ballistic missile yet last week - the solid-fuel Hwasong 18 intercontinental ballistic missile. It was not clear how far the missile went - but it was launched toward North Korea's eastern waters. Seoul, Tokyo and Washington said it was as a ""clear, flagrant violation"" of many UN Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, US troops are staging ""Operation Bully Stick"" to practice loading a nuclear missile. The drills aims ""to load an intercontinental ballistic missile into a launch facility as safely, efficiently, and quickly as possible"". During Tuesday's meeting, South Korea and the US agreed to share information, establish a secure comms network - and coordinate and plan for a possible North Korean nuclear attack. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said: ""Through a South Korea-US alliance upgraded to a new nuclear-based paradigm, we will make substantial efforts to fundamentally block North Korea's nuclear and missile threats."" But North Korea blasted the bold manoeuvre. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong-un, said such actions would ""make North Korea go farther away"" from possible talks. She dismissed the idea of talks with the US as ""a daydream"". ""It is a daydream for the US to think that it can stop the advance of the DPRK... and achieve irreversible disarmament through the interim suspension of joint military exercises,"" she said. The best way to ensure peace was to deter the US with force ""rather than solving the problem with the gangster-like Americans in a friendly manner,"" Kim Yo Jong said. China also slammed the new Nuclear Consultative Group for raising tensions in the region.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000832520449.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/e1804b61-e135-443a-be9b-8f058afbe660.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/VP-MAP-DEFCON-UN-v2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-south-korean-president-yoon-832715066.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hwasong-18-undisclosed-location-north-831360910.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/conducting-trilateral-ballistic-missile-defense-832420917.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-norths-warplanes-repelled-u-830881272.jpg",US deploys nuke-armed submarine to North Korea’s doorstep for the first time in 40 years as they ‘plan for nuclear war’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23090987/us-nuke-submarine-north-korea-nuclear-war/
"SWIMMING along the surface, teenager Addison Bethea was on the lookout for scallops when she felt something tugging at her leg. Expecting to see her half-brother Rhett, she turned around to look - and came face-to-face with a 9ft bull shark. Addison, now 18, desperately tried to free herself from the terrifying beast as it tore at her right limb. The high school student was saved by firefighter Rhett, who kicked the shark until it let go - then made a makeshift 4ft tourniquet to save her life. Addison's story features in a new BBC One documentary - Why Sharks Attack - which airs tonight. The pair were diving for scallops last July when the shark struck about a mile-and-a-half off the coast of Keaton Beach near Grassy Island in Taylor County, Florida. The water was just 5ft deep. Addison, of Perry, Florida, recalled: “I felt something grabbing me. I thought it was Rhett as it pulled me under because I didn’t feel any pain or anything. “But then it started kind of shaking me and that’s when I knew it was something else. “It started biting into my right thigh and I was gouging its eye to get it off me and then it started swimming away with me still in its mouth.” Addison’s half-brother Rhett Willingham describes how he punched and kicked the shark until it let go of her. ""I heard Addison yell and she surfaced and I immediately could see this tail, just slashing back and forth,"" he said. “I grabbed her and started hitting it to get it off.” Rhett, 23, managed to get Addison to their small boat and they were picked up by a larger vessel which spotted they were in distress and took them to Keaton beach. The documentary reveals footage of Addison after their boat landed ashore and shows Rhett struggling to keep her conscious. He tells the first police officer on the scene: “Dude it was huge and I literally had to pry it off her.” Addison is heard screaming ""Help me” as Rhett tells her: “We’re not losing you.” Addison recalls: “Rhett kept tapping me on my face and saying 'You’re going to be okay' and I said, ‘Okay’. “You obviously just want to go to sleep because you’re in shock and keep passing out and (I was) losing a lot of blood.” Addison was airlifted to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital where she had emergency surgery to save her life. Rhett says: “Once the burden of having to deal with that (saving Addison) was off me, I was like, holy cow, that’s quite deep man.” Addison, a keen cheerleader and tennis player, later told how she tried desperately to get the shark off her by trying to punch it on the nose, but couldn’t reach due to the way it had clamped its jaws on her thigh. She said: “I remember from watching Animal Planet you’re supposed to punch them in the nose or something - but I couldn’t get around to his nose the way he bit me.” Dad Shane hailed his son a hero, saying: “If Rhett hadn’t been there, we would be at the funeral home instead of the hospital. That boy is the definition of a hero. “The shark attacked Addison’s right leg, front quad muscle. It was completely annihilated. It was devastating, a nasty, nasty wound. The shark attacked Addison’s right leg, front quad muscle. It was completely annihilated. It was devastating, a nasty, nasty wound “The vascular surgeon took the vein from the left leg and turned it into an artery for the right leg to get blood flow.” Six days after her first surgery Addison had an operation to amputate her leg above the knee - and took her first steps using a walker the next day. Statistics show you are more likely to be bitten by a shark in America than anywhere else, with the US confirming 41 bites out of 57 worldwide last year - one of which was fatal. Florida is the hotspot for attacks , with 16 victims last year. The most dangerous spot is Volusia County, which includes the popular resort Daytona Beach. Last year sharks bit 16 people in encounters off Florida’s waters. Among the victims, people swimming and wading were most likely to be bitten, followed by surfers and board sports, then snorkelers and divers. The odds of being attacked and killed by a shark are one in 3.7million, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. The predator that bit Addison is most likely to be a bull shark, which have been known to attack spear fisherman, according to Professor Gavin Naylor, a researcher for the Florida Program for Shark Research. He said changing environments mean sharks are drawn to different areas in search of food “which might prompt them to bite humans when they otherwise wouldn't”. ""I'm surprised Addison was bitten because you don't get many shark bites in this area,"" he added.

"THIS is the eerie moment a woman was filmed ""stuck on a loop"" in the middle of a busy street. The video was posted to TikTok and left stunned viewers claiming it was a real-life ""glitch in the Matrix"" . In the 19-second clip, a woman wearing a winter coat and jeans while holding a handbag and facemask can be seen standing beside the back of a car . She appears to be smiling at a digital camera before turning the device around every few seconds. The unidentified woman remains in her spot while seemingly taking a  photo of herself, but viewers were shocked when they noticed that no other part of her body of face was moving. Only the woman's wrist was moving as she flicked the camera back and forth, with her arm staying outstretched in the same position for the entire length of the video. The woman can be seen grinning into the lens with wide eyes as she appears to be in a never-ending cycle of selfie taking. The spooked cameraman films the bizarre scene from what looks like a bus window and records the woman ""stuck in a loop"" until the vehicle drives on and she exits the view. Racking up a mega 2.2million likes, baffled TikTok users were also quick to leave their theories in the comment section. One asked: ""Is that a real life glitch?"" Another wrote: ""This what you call a non-playable character! Everything is a simulation"". A third said: ""The matrix is real"". A fourth commented: ""Simulation crashing"". One more added: ""BUG in the Matrix"". This comes after a viral TikTok clip that shows a woman ""frozen in time"" left viewers convinced that the Matrix is real.

"BOOZY Brits are busy soaking up the 32C sunshine in Benidorm - defying warnings over a heatwave scorching southern Europe. The slightly sunburnt revellers were pictured throwing back beers and partying in bikinis at beachside bars in the holiday hotspot yesterday. Others made the most of the summer weather as they soaked up the rays on the sand. It comes as forecasters issued warnings over the ""Charon"" heat storm that is set to send temperatures soaring into the 40s this week in Spain, Italy and Greece. But in true 'keep calm and carry on' style, nothing was going to ruin these Brits' getaways as they smiled through the heat in the Spanish party town. Spain's meteorological agency, AEMET, predicted the heatwave would reach its peak in Benidorm and the rest of the Alicante region between July 17 - 19. And yet, these holidaymakers looked ready to paint the town red with buckets full of Corona and fruity cocktails. They were spotted dancing on tables and partying through the high temperatures yesterday. Today, AEMET set a yellow alert for high temperatures all over the Alicante province for the peak times of 12.20pm to 8.30pm. Tomorrow the yellow alert will become orange for the southern coast as the mercury could hit 43C. Nearby, other British tourists are battling a red weather alert in Majorca. The Spanish resort island is expecting temperatures of up to 43C, with tomorrow set to be the hottest day of the year so far. AEMET issued the red alert, warning of ""extreme risk"" to health - especially for the elderly, young babies and those with existing illnesses. The Foreign Office has also warned Brits heading to Europe to take care due to the possible health risks associated with ""extreme"" heat, particularly in Spain and Greece . Experts urged tourists and locals to stay hydrated and remain in the shade as a ""Charon"" heat storm hits resorts around the Med. Holidaymakers are being advised to avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine as the mercury rises in countries across the Mediterranean. In some areas, wildfires are raging across the continent as experts fear that the red-hot temperatures could continue for weeks. Forests are on fire in Spain, Greece, Italy, Switzerland and Turkey , while France, Germany and Poland also prepare for scorching conditions. Forecasters from the United Nations' weather agency the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) have warned that the hot weather is expected to persist into the start of August. The UN agency said the weather - which is refusing to relent even overnight - brings an increased risk of heart attacks and deaths. Meteorologists said the mercury will soar up to 46C across southern Europe for several days, leaving Brits heading abroad considering how to dodge the sun. The temperatures are expected to hit their peak this afternoon in Sardinia , Italy. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509622.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509598.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509181.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509510.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509329.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509590.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509527.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/greece-starting-mass-evacuations-ferocious-832509555.jpg",Benidorm Brits hit the booze by the beach as they defy ‘Charon’ heat storm warnings and soak up 32C sun,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23092575/benidorm-british-booze-beach-heat-storm-warning-sun/
"WALMART heiress Nancy Walton Laurie has used her grocery billions to create a life of astonishing luxury. She and her ex-basketball star husband sail the world in a £240million superyacht - when not staying at one of their collection of mansions across the US. Nancy gained her fortune after her father Bud Walton co-founded the massive Walmart empire. Upon his death, she and her sister inherited his billions and got richer as the empire grew. One of Nancy's properties is a massive Bel-Air mansion, which she built buy buying a few neighbouring properties and joining them together. She spent a whopping £46million perfecting the property between 2001 and 2022. The sprawling grounds feature a swimming pool, a main house and other guest buildings, along with tennis courts - a property fit for the Walmart princess. According to the Center for Investigative Reporting, Walton uses “at least 2.3 million gallons per year” to water her Bel Air estate. The heiress also owns a stunning ranch style property in Columbia, Missouri, as well as houses in her native Nevada, where she resides with husband Bill Laurie. Her multi-million pound super yacht was spotted sailing through the Thames earlier this year. Super yacht Kaos is worth an estimated £241million, with a stunning interior, fit with a full swimming pool, dining area and room for a smaller boat. The lounge area has gold ceilings, with dark wood features and marble bathrooms. It's no surprise the Walmart heiress opts for luxury - as she's worth an estimated £6billion. This week, the massive yacht was vandalised by eco warriors after docking in Ibiza. Shocking video footage of the vandalism shows the stern of the vessel - named Kaos - being spattered with red and black paint as deckhands try to hose it off. The activists then held up a sign saying ""You Consume Others Suffer"" before they can been seen being spoken to by a security guard. In addition to owning her massive properties, she uses her riches for philanthropy. Nancy owns the Columbia Performing Arts Centre in Ohio, and has donated millions to her alma mater, the University of Missouri. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Lauries have also made donations to cancer research centres, shelters for abused women and a children's hospital. Laurie is the youngest daughter of Bud Walton, who's brother Sam began what would become the world's largest retail store. The first-ever Walmart store opened in July 1962 in Arkansas , and the heirs own around 50 percent of the stock collectively. Also that year, the Walton family took a huge financial hit after Walmart's share price plummeted by 10 percent in 2022. The fall in shares due to the company's sale of its operations in the UK and Japan and a cut in profit expectations, saw the heirs lose over $27billion. Its founder and his wife Helen Walton had four children - Rob, John, Jim, and Alice. John passed away in 2005 in a plane crash but the three surviving siblings remain billionaires.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nancy-walton-laurie-family-went-832749402.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/one-per-cent-world-population-832343562-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nancy-walton-laurie-family-went-832749005.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/queen-seas-inside-walmart-heiress-820153879.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2kxpkra-82-5-meter-long-832745277.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/husband-bill-owner-st-louis-832750001.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bill-laurie-nancy-waltons-house-832750452.jpg",Inside Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie’s glam £6BILLION life as she sails world in £240million superyacht,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23105510/walmart-heiress-nancy-walton-mansion-yacht/
"WAGNER chief Yevegeny Prigozhin appeared to break cover for the first time since his botched rebellion as he welcomed his fighters to Belarus. The whereabouts of Putin's former lap dog has been a mystery for weeks as thousands of Wagner troops have reportedly been arriving in Belarus . In a video posted on pro-Wagner Telegram channels, a man who appeared to be Prigozhin dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket was filmed addressing hundreds of fighters. ""Welcome lads... welcome to Belarusian soil,"" he said in the video shot at dusk. The footage comes just days after Russia threatened to use Wagner fighters to invade Nato’s ""weakest link"" in Poland and Lithuania - and strike from Belarus in ""a matter of hours"". During Prigozhin's speech, he rallied his troops - branding the Ukraine frontline a ""disgrace"" that Wagner should not take part in. Prigozhin told his men to behave - and ordered them to train up the Belarusian army to become the ""second best in the world"". ""We fought honourably,"" he said. ""You have done a great deal for Russia. What is going on at the front is a disgrace that we do not need to get involved in. “Therefore a decision was taken for us to station here in Belarus for some time. I am sure that during this time we will make the Belarusian army second greatest in the world. ""And if needed, we will defend them if it comes to it.” The Wagner boss also told his fighters to collect their strength for a ""new journey to Africa"" - and not to offend Belarusian women. ""And perhaps we will return to the SMO (special military operation in Ukraine) at some point when we are sure that we will not be forced to shame ourselves,"" Prigozhin said. A man who sounded like Dmitry Utkin, who helped found Wagner, then spoke to the men. The footage has not yet been verified - and it's not clear when it was taken. Analysts have suggested it was filmed at a base near Asipovičy - a town in the Mogilev region of Belarus. Prigozhin's mutiny was halted at the eleventh hour after Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko intervened and said Wagner fighters could be housed in Belarus. Prigozhin's whereabouts has not been confirmed since he marched on Moscow in the extraordinary armed rebellion. Conflicting reports over the last three weeks suggested he was still in Russia, possibly purged by Putin - or even dead. Last week, an embarrassing image emerged of the warlord sitting on a camp bed in his pants. But the latest video marks what could be a significant development in finally confirming his whereabouts - and future plans. Earlier, Sir Richard Moor, the head of MI6, said he was aware Prigozhin had tea with Putin in recent days - despite the Russian leader calling him a ""traitor"". The footage comes after a top Putin parliamentarian claimed on TV that Wagner mercenaries was ready to strike from Belarus. The Suwalki Corridor - or Gap - is a 60-mile strip of land straddling the border between Poland and Lithuania . It has massive strategic importance for Nato and the EU - as well as Russia . For the West, it is the only land link to the three ex-Soviet Baltic republics - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - which are seen as vulnerable to Putin if current tensions worsen. For Russia, control of the corridor would give a land link between the Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad, main base of Putin’s Baltic Fleet, and firm Kremlin ally Belarus. Reservist Colonel General Andrey Kartapolov said: ""It is clear that Wagner went to Belarus to train the Belarusian armed forces… “There is such a place as the Suwalki Corridor. “Should anything happen, we need this Suwalki Corridor very much… “A strike force [based in Wagner forces in Belarus] is ready to take this corridor in a matter of hours.” His “shock fist” land grab plan would hit sparsely populated territory which has been labelled Nato’s “Achilles heel” or “soft underbelly”. Because it could be the first point of contact in a third world war, the corridor has been branded “the most dangerous place on earth”. A Russian move here with state-backed Wagner would likely trigger Nato’s clause 5 - setting the alliance against Russia. Poland is rapidly rearming due to the threat from Moscow, and Germany is to deploy 4,000 troops permanently in Lithuania as Nato strengthens its presence in the Baltic states.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/83c816aa-8b29-41d5-9234-ddd2445fae24.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/416f6b0d-3b97-4941-990b-2b216ec3f17e.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-head-wagner-group-yevgeny-831686485-3.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1e61fbff-7fd5-4ec5-94ef-d52b281b1040.jpg",Wagner coup warlord ‘seen for first time rallying troops’ in Belarus after Putin’s chilling threat to invade Nato,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23107494/wagner-warlord-seen-first-time-belarus/
"LOCKED in a tiny air pocket at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, Harrison Okene could only pray as he listened to the horrifying sounds of fish feeding on the bodies of his dead colleagues. Although he knew he could suffer a similar fate, the Nigerian chef was determined to stay alive after a wave sent their boat sinking to the depths of the ocean in 2013. Harrison's terrifying ordeal is one of a handful of inspirational tales from over the years about those who found themselves lost at sea . This week, Aussie Tim Shaddock became the latest real-life cast away to beat the odds, surviving on raw fish and rainwater for two months on a catamaran. Here, we look at more stories of bravery, resilience, and determination. Harrison's vessel had set sail off the coast of Nigeria to secure a large oil tanker. Although they had to make their way through turbulent waters, they never expected the terrifying fate that was to come. As the boat was smashed by a huge swell, it began to quickly sink. Harrison was thrown across a cabin, but was handed a lifeline when an air pocket formed, giving the then-29-year-old oxygen to breathe. In a bid to survive, he stacked up mattresses to stay afloat but was almost certain he would succumb to his death. Describing his horrific ordeal years later, he said: ""I had access to nothing. I thought of my family, I thought of my mum, my brothers, my wife... there was no way to get to them and I knew I was going to die."" After spending several hours in the pitch-black chamber, he began to hear the chilling sound of fish tearing through the flesh of his dead colleagues. Speaking to 9News, he said: ""I never knew if they were sharks or not, it was so dark. I heard them biting something. I was scared, I had to stay and keep watch to see if something would come my direction."" Sixty hours later and with no idea how long the air pocket would last, Harrison had given up all hopes of making it out alive - only to hear a knocking sound. Miraculously, Harrison saw some light coming in through the deep. It was the flashlight of South African deep sea diver, Nico van Heerden, who along with a team had been sent to recover the bodies of the crew. Harrison managed to gently tap on van Heerden's gear to alert him of his presence - the team couldn't believe that he had managed to spend nearly three days at the bottom of the ocean. Speaking about the moment he was rescued, Harrison says: ""When he came, I was just crying. He never knew what I was thinking. ""I was not afraid at that time. I had already decided if it's to be alive or dead, no problem. I had been ready to go [but] God heard my prayers."" Although Harrison later vowed never to return to the sea after suffering nightmares, he became a certified diver in 2015. To date, experts are still baffled by how he managed to stay alive for so long. In November 2012, Jose Salvador Alvarenga set sail off the Mexican coast on a 30-hour shift of deep-sea fishing but soon came into difficulty following a ferocious storm which lasted five days. Jose and his inexperienced partner, Ezequiel Cordoba, who he had just recruited for the trip, were left without food or water and no sense of direction. The Salvadoran fisherman faced hunger and encounters with terrifying sharks as he hopelessly navigated the frightening Pacific Ocean. He stayed alive by feasting on small birds, turtles, and jellyfish, which he had to scoop from the sea. In an interview, after he was found, Jose said: ""It burned the top part of my throat, but wasn’t so bad."" He added: ""We had to drink our own urine after the storm. It wasn’t until a month later that we finally got some rainwater.” While Jose knew his survival depended on his energy, Ezequiel, 23, was reluctant to eat raw birds and ended up starving to death. Back in his home country, a search party sent out to find the men found no trace of them and gave up after a couple of days, citing poor visibility. Although Jose contemplated killing himself, he decided against it due to his Christian faith. While trapped at sea, he saw several container ships but was unable to call for help. He finally saw some land, which turned out to be a tiny islet at the corner of the Marshall Islands. Abandoning his boat on January 30, 2014, he swam to shore an incredible 14 months later, coming across a beach house owned by a couple. When he was found, he was weak, struggled to walk without assistance, and had bushy hair. He was taken to a hospital for medical care and returned home to El Salvador for an emotional reunion with his family. In 1983, Tami Oldham Ashcraft set off from Tahiti with her British fiance Richard Sharp on an adventure to San Diego when she was 23. The couple, however, ended up sailing right into Hurricane Raymond. After the full force of the wind struck, their boat stood no chance after being hit by 40-foot waves. As the vessel was capsized, Tami was thrown against a cabin wall and knocked unconscious. When she woke up 27 hours later, she realised that her beloved husband-to-be was lost at sea. The boat had been flooded and its radio and navigation system was no longer working. Determined to survive, she made a makeshift sail from the ruins of the boat, designed a pump to drain the water, and set off towards Hawaii . Surviving on a diet of canned food and peanut butter, she managed to last for 41 days before reaching Hilo, Hawaii. Speaking about her terrifying experience, she said: ""When I was out there, Richard was with me. I felt his presence, I talked to him constantly, I slept with his clothes around me. ""I heard his voice consoling me, encouraging me, and helping me to keep going in my darkest time."" Her story was turned into a 2018 film called Adrift, with Shailene Woodley playing her and Sam Claflin starring as Richard. In parts of the Pacific, people get around from one island to another by using small boats. Although it was routine for three friends, Filo Filo, Etueni Nasau, and Samu Pelsa, they lost sight of the shore and became disoriented when they sailed off from Tokelau in 2010. The teenagers, who were aged 14 and 15 at the time, drifted further away from land and into the ocean. The water and 20 coconuts they had brought with them had run out within two days. For the next 48 days, they were forced to eat birds to survive. After searches by local teams and New Zealand Air Force proved futile, their friends and family presumed they had died and arranged a memorial service for them, attended by 500 mourners. Meanwhile, the boys got so desperate that they began drinking seawater - experts have noted that this is often a sign that death is imminent. But after drifting over 500 miles, they were spotted by a fishing boat. Upon seeing their physical appearance, the sailor took them to Fiji for emergency care. Tai Fredeicsen, who was in charge of the vessel that discovered them, said: ""Their bones were protruding from underneath their skin. But mentally and spiritually, very high."" Steven Callahan always had a passion for boats and was determined to one day sail across the Atlantic Ocean. That dream came to fruition in 1981, as he chartered his own vessel called the Napoleon Solo. Departing from Newport on Rhode Island, he sailed to Bermuda and even made it to Cornwall before heading for Antigua. The Napoleon Solo suffered irreparable damage, however, when it collided with a whale. Steven ended up abandoning it and carried on in an inflatable life raft that measured six feet. After exhausting his limited food supplies, he survived by catching mahi-mahi as well as triggerfish and birds. He had many close calls after coming face-to-face with sharks and punctures to the raft. After 76 days at sea, he was picked up by fishermen drawn to birds flying over the raft. He had lost a third of his weight and was covered in saltwater sores and in need of medical assistance. He spent six weeks recovering at a hospital. Parts of Steven's story inspired the 2012 movie Life of Pi after he was consulted by director Ang Lee. Rolando Omongos went missing while sailing on a tiny boat from the Philippines to Papua New Guinea aged 21. His uncle had taken him along on a fishing trip in December 2017 but a storm separated the two men, leaving them fighting for their lives. Following a month of hunger and exposure, Rolando's uncle died. He latched his body to the boat for a few days but later released it into the ocean after it began to smell. Rolando was able to survive by drinking rainwater and eating moss growing at the hulk of his boat. Several boats passed him by each day, refusing to stop. Nearly two months later, he was found by a Japanese fishing vessel - he incredibly weighed just 20kg, having lost 41kg. Speaking about his will to stay alive, he said: ""I never lost hope. I was always praying. I told myself, at least one of us had to get back home.” He added: ""I cried non-stop when I was finally rescued. I was too weak to stand up and they had to carry me.”","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2013-heavy-swell-caused-vessel-57724751.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/harrison-odjegba-okene-second-left-832734438.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2013-harrison-odjegba-okene-right-832734259.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mexican-castaway-identified-jose-ivan-67497874.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/leaving-home-mexico-15-years-69322853-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2014-shows-claimed-boat-pacific-68026840.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2014-alvarenga-salvadoran-castaway-says-204387045.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/allthatsinteresting-com-tami-oldham-ashcraft-416004239.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tami-oldham-survivor-41-days-415998136.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/survivors-etueni-nasau-14-samu-832742535.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2002-20-years-ago-callahan-92861592-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2017-omongos-flew-home-philippines-832567837.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2017-filipino-fisherman-cast-adrift-832567841.jpg",I survived 3 days inside flooded cabin in middle of ocean while fish fed on bodies around me – I still have nightmares,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23099546/real-life-castaways-survival-stories-ocean/
"A HOTEL worker tragically died after part of a clamp ended up in his brain during a nose job. Luis Fernando Dávila Castañeda was declared brain dead in hospital following the rhinoplasty procedure at a private clinic in Peru . An x-ray revealed a small metal clamp seen in his brain tissue, as doctors say he suffered irreversible brain damage. The victim, who worked as the manager of the nearby Hotel Boca Raton, was taken to the Hospital EsSalud after falling ill. Castañeda's boss at the hotel said he contacted the hospital after realising the procedure had lasted longer than planned. After carrying out a thorough examination, doctors are said to have discovered a foreign object lodged in the man’s brain. Castañeda passed away in intensive care on July 7, and the Public Prosecutor's Office has launched an investigation. The victim's uncle Héctor Quintana said: “We want justice. “We hope the police and the Prosecutor's Office will thoroughly investigate the matter to determine who is responsible.” The victim’s family has filed a complaint with the authorities, accusing the clinic of negligence. The Public Prosecutor’s Office has launched an investigation. The Peruvian National Police reportedly carried out checks at the clinic and tried to interview surgeon Carlos Larios Villasis, but he was away on business at the time. The victim's family has claimed the clinic hung up after they kept asking questions about his death. Earlier this year, a woman died only hours after a routine nose job went wrong and left her lungs ""full of blood"". The psychology student from Colombia , South America, fell unconscious soon after she arrived home from the surgery on January 29. After her family revived her they rushed her to hospital where she suffered several cardiac arrests - which is what happens when the heart stops pumping. Another woman lost both of her legs after an infection from a botched nose job ""rotted them from inside out"". Sevinc Ceklik, 31, was only 25-years-old when she decided to go under the knife to have a nose reduction surgery at a private hospital in Istanbul. After the surgery, her legs then turned black, forcing her to be hospitalised in a critical condition where emergency doctors diagnosed her with blood poisoning.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/luis-fernando-d-vila-casta-832531938.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/x-ray-showing-section-clamp-832531997.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/x-ray-showing-section-clamp-832531941-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/luis-fernando-d-vila-casta-832531930.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/luis-fernando-d-vila-casta-832531925.jpg",Hotel worker dies during horror botched nose job after metal clamp gets lodged in his brain,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23108223/hotel-worker-dead-clamp-brain-botched-nose-job/
"A BRIT mum is building a luxury cave with a sauna and chandeliers after buying the land for just £11,000. Jennifer Ayres, 50, moved to Australia 15 years ago and is now on a mission to build the unique cavern home. The mum-of-two started the project last year, after living in a tent for three months and then a caravan while she dug her new home with the help of a local cave-building expert. Jennifer is hoping to turn the dusty cave into a two-bedroom house and one-bedroom ""granny flat"" that she can rent out - after purchasing the land for just £11,000. The water engineer originally from Darlington, Durham , has also been collecting luxurious statement pieces to kit out the cave with such as a copper bath, black standalone sink, a Smeg integrated coffee machine, temple doors from India and several chandeliers. ""My friends are killing themselves laughing about this, but it will be the most luxurious cave house imaginable, including a sauna and a gym,"" she said. Instead of forking out on contractors and architects, the ambitious mum personally moved thousands of tonnes of dirt with machinery she bought herself after drawing her own ""dream cave"" designs. ""I have already moved thousands of tons of dirt with a conveyor belt and I thought it would be easier if I also got my own Bobcat – a machine to easily move materials from one location to another – so I can dump it by myself as well,"" she said. ""I couldn't afford an architect to draw the plans so I taught myself to do it."" The cavern home is being built in Coober Pedy, just north of Adelaide , where temperatures rise to almost 50C in the summer seasons. Jennifer explained this is why most residents either use old mines or dig their own caves as they stay a comfortable 22C to 24C all year round. The 50-year-old has set a personal goal to have the tunnelling completed by Christmas - but there's still a long way to go. Jennifer has to dig a whopping six metres to reach ground that's solid enough to build her cave which will create an insanely steep driveway that will one day lead to her front door. ""After tunnelling, I still have to do a lot of work on the internals – I'm going to be doing most of that myself as well,"" she said. Jennifer explained that she will also need to learn how to lay concrete tiles for the floor,  as well as installing the plumbing and electric. The budding builder has already spent £60,000 on the build so far, but said it's been worth every penny to work on her dream home. As the building is ongoing, the mum is living in her caravan while her husband and two adult kids stay at their family home in Adelaide. Her husband drops by sometimes to visit, but she mostly spends time alone in sunny Coober Pedy getting to know her new local community. She revealed that she's been playing golf in the desert with a Catholic priest, joined the gun club and has been visiting underground pubs and restaurants. But with the hug project underway, Jennifer is in no rush to finish it. ""If I want the cave house, I will have it, even if it takes me 10 years. I'll sit there and do it, because it's fun,"" she said. ""I don't just want to get a team of builders, but I want it to be my house, that I built."" This comes after one couple turned a cave into a family home for five in just seven months, but they still battle the major issue of bad smells. And a hermit told how he built a tiny cave home in a remote mountain after becoming sick of people hassling him.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767393120.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767393203.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767393408.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767393488.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767393256.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767393239.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767393454.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/complete-chandeliers-sauna-jennifer-ayres-767398360.jpg","I’m building the world’s most luxurious CAVE with sauna & chandeliers after buying land for just £11k, says Brit mum",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23109813/world-luxurious-cave-sauna-chandeliers-buying-land-brit-mum/
"A SHOOTER went on a horrifying gun rampage at a building site near a stadium in New Zealand that left two dead and six injured. Matu Tangi Mantua Reid, 24, launched a frenzied attack in Auckland just hours before the FIFA Women's World Cup kick-off. The gunman shot at several civilians at a construction site located just yards away in Eden Park stadium as terrified workers were seen running for their lives. Cops rushed to the scene following reports of a person firing shots inside the site on lower Queen Street at around 7.22 am local time. The shooter moved through the building site and continued to fire his pump-action shotgun. He was later found dead in a lift shaft. Police Commissioner Andrew Koster said: ""At around 8am our armed offenders squad supported by the special tactics group located the offender inside a lift shaft where he had barricaded himself and attempted to engage him, having secured the floors above and below. ""Shots were exchanged, and the offender was later located deceased."" He added that the injured officer was in a stable condition and would undergo surgery today before confirming the shooter did not have a gun license. ""This was a terrifying experience,"" he said. A significant number of police responded and cordoned off the area. A cop helicopter was also deployed and provided oversight of the unfolding situation. New Zealand Police tweeted: ""Upon reaching the upper levels of the building, the male has contained himself within the elevator shaft and our staff have attempted to engage with him"". ""Further shots were fired from the male and he was located deceased a short time later. ""Details around what has exactly occurred are still emerging and police will continue to provide updates around injuries and the circumstances"". Three people, including the gunman, were killed in the shooting while at least ten were injured. Reid was serving a sentence of five months of home detention at the time of the shooting, according to the New Zealand Herald. He had been charged with a string of domestic violence offences and was tracked through an ankle monitor. However, he had approval to travel from the property where he was serving home detention to the building site where he worked. New Zealand's Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, has also confirmed that the football tournament will proceed as planned. “Aucklanders and those watching around the world can be assured that the police have neutralised the threat and that they are not seeking anybody else in relation to the incident,” Hipkins said. The building site that the incident occurred in is located close to the Eden Park stadium where the World Cup opening is set to take place. The construction company LT McGuiness confirmed the gunman was a subcontractor. ""Today’s tragic event has been a huge shock to us all,"" it said in a statement. ""Our thoughts are with the victims and their families, and all those impacted by the incident that occurred on our site this morning ."" New Zealand Football tweeted: ""New Zealand Football are shocked by the incident in Auckland CBD this morning . ""We can confirm that all of the Football Ferns team and staff are safe but we will not be able to comment further while details are still emerging"". Speaking in Parliament , Hipkins confirmed the two people killed by the gunman were civilians. His understanding is that there “was no political or ideological motive for the shooting”. “This is a scary situation for Aucklanders on their Thursday morning commute to work. Please stay at home, avoid travel into the city centre,” Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown wrote in a tweet . New Zealand is due to play Norway at the World Cup opener tonight.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abd20e12-a511-4fd8-a292-7b7bfd479727.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/workmen-forced-take-cover-behind-832888998.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-video-injured-police-officer-832847499.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-linked-national-security-threat-832845740-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-new-zealand-police-responding-832829619.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-vehicles-seen-near-location-832826224.jpg",New Zealand shooting: Horror hours before Women’s World Cup as gunman kills two & wounds six near Auckland stadium,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23112588/new-zealand-shooting-two-dead-as-gunman-open-fires/
"MYSTERY surrounds the death of a British woman who was found dead on a walking trail on a popular Greek island. The body of the 73-year-old tourist was found in a mountainous area in Kefalonia. Greek cops were looking for the woman's husband, also a Brit but they were unable to locate him. The 71-year-old turned up at the local police station this morning where he gave a statement, inkefalonia reports. The pair were staying at a hotel in the coastal town of Sami. The woman's body has been sent for a forensic examination in Patras. The Kefalonia Police Department has launched an investigation into the woman's death. Another British tourist was found dead in Greece last month while his terrified wife frantically called for help. The 65-year-old died in the village of Horto in Pelion in northern Greece where the couple had gone for a holiday. According to local media, the man was found dead in bed by his wife who frantically called for help. And a Brit holidaymaker was pulled unconscious from the water on a Greek beach in June. The 64-year-old man was pulled out of the sea by other tourists at the beach of ​​Alykanas in Zante. The man was taken to the Zakynthos General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

"THIS is the moment an unsuspecting British diver was attacked by a great white shark as it clenched its jaws around his GoPro. The incredible footage captures the inside of the gigantic beast's mouth as it tries to take a bite out of the underwater camera. Mark Graham, 31, from Preston caught his terrifying encounter with the great white on film before he swam to safety. The brave diver, who works as a videographer and is founder of  White Shark Ocean project, captured the video in Mossel Bay, South Africa . Once in the water, Graham suddenly saw the ocean predator circling the boat. The shark then roars over to him and gets up close and personal. It seems to be especially inquisitive about the mysterious electrical device on his head and takes a closer look. The footage shows the great white shark opening its giant jaws to reveal all of its sparkling and sharp gnashers. Despite its proximity to Graham's face, he says that he never felt scared or uncomfortable. Instead, he was impressed by how gentle the beast had been. “The shark was super inquisitive, having such a personal and gentle interaction with such a big animal felt extremely captivating. “It was an incredibly gentle interaction from the shark,"" he added. “It was just trying to figure out what the strange electrical thingy in the water was. “People seem to love the clip. I think when it gently bumps the camera at the end people get a little freaked out. “Their electro receptors can pick up the GoPro so they get super curious and come in close to investigate.” It comes as a footage captured the chilling moment another massive great white shark in South Africa glides silently towards three unsuspecting surfers . The 10ft beast sniffed its way towards competitors in an elite surfing championship in Jeffreys Bay - the scene of a spine-chilling attack only years earlier. The great white can be seen swimming along the coast and stalking its way towards them. Earlier this month, it was announced that great white sharks could soon appear in UK waters including at a popular tourist destination. Marine experts at Ocearch claimed the predators could migrate north from the Mediterranean in search of seals and begin appearing off the shores of northern France and around Cornwall . Their investigations show that the creatures have been increasingly spotted off the New England coast in the US in recent years. Chris Fischer, founder of Ocearch, told the Times : ""We believe that Mediterranean white sharks should be moving north to feed on seals, like all the other populations we have worked on. ""We believe they should be moving up past Brest [in Brittany] and Cornwall.""","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/f5858412-c273-4600-a2f2-a517387d0809.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/preston-uk-captured-moment-great-832942428.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/83d3bd72-0c65-4e1b-8c8a-3096232b6040.jpg",Shocking PoV video shows moment great white shark tries to BITE GoPro on diver’s head,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23115855/pov-moment-great-white-shark-bite-gopro-diver/
"TOURISTS in Tenerife have been warned to be wary as a dangerous species that can cause meningitis is invading the holiday hotspot. Parts of the island are being overrun by Giant African land snails , which scientists say pose a ""significant threat"" to humans. Officials have now issued a stark warning to holidaymakers to steer clear of the ""very dangerous"" invertebrates swarming Tenerife . They are known as the ""world's most damaging"" snail species due to their penchant for destruction and being riddled with parasites. It is the first time Giant African land snails have been spotted in the Canary Islands or Tenerife - where a whopping 230,000 Brits flocked to in March this year alone. The Network for the Detection and Intervention of Invasive Alien Species in the Canary Islands (REDEXOS) said they are constantly receiving more reports of sightings as the species spread. Boffins stressed that people should not touch the huge snails, which can reach up to 20cm in length, as it could land them with a deadly infection. The creatures, scientifically known as Lissachatina fulica, are typically light brown and sport dark bands across their shell. Experts warn close contact with the snails ""represents a significant threat to human health , agriculture and the ecosystem in general."" The invasive molluscs harbour a grim parasite known as rat lungworm, which can trigger meningitis in humans. They also pose a threat to crops, flowers and infrastructure, due to their appetite for around 500 different plant species as well as paint and stucco. REDEXOS suspect the Giant African land snails may have been smuggled into Tenerife to be sold to mollusc and reptile collectors. The creatures are considered invasive due to their ability to reproduce rapidly - as they can lay up to 2,500 eggs each year. REDEXOS have launched a social media campaign to alert tourists and locals to the danger, sharing snaps of the snails to help people recognise their distinctive shells. A spokesperson for the organisation urged people to call 645 601 457 if they spot any of the snails - but warned they should not approach. They added: ""Citizen collaboration is essential to control the spread of this species and minimise its detrimental effects."" Giant African land snails tend to thrive in hot and humid climates,  although they are capable of living in temperate climates too. They often live along the edges of forests, banks of rivers and streams, shrublands, agricultural areas, plantations, gardens, wetlands, and in various urban sites. Thousands of Americans were placed under quarantine after a Giant African land snail was spotted in the US in July last year. A community gardener found one roaming around New Port Richey, located about 38 miles to the northwest of Tampa , Florida. Police believed a woman smuggled the snails on a flight from Africa to Miami by hiding them under her skirt. Two were then spotted crawling down a busy street in the centre of London after being dumped in a lettuce-filled cardboard box.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/human-hand-holds-snail-palm-702489344.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/aerial-view-town-called-bajamar-795917758.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/giant-african-snail-potential-health-832952991.jpg",Holiday alert over ‘invading species’ in Tenerife that can cause meningitis as experts warn of ‘significant threat’,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23117058/holiday-alert-invading-species-tenerife-cause-meningitis/
"ACAPULCO once embodied the glamour of the jet age - an easy-going paradise resort loved by Hollywood pin-ups and royalty. But the ""Pearl of the Pacific"" is now plagued by sickening cartel violence and is so dangerous locals reportedly take guns to the beach. Up to 20 criminal gangs including El Chapo 's Sinaloa mob are said to be fighting a bloody turf war for control of nearby poppy fields. The once-thriving tourist town is now among the most violent places in the world, with the second-highest murder rate in Mexico - more than one per 1,000 people every year. The US government warns its citizens should not go anywhere in the Guerrero region and has banned all government officials from visiting Acapulco. It issued a fresh warning to Spring Break revellers this year following a spate of kidnappings and murders. The UK's Foreign Office also warns against all travel to Guerrero - with the exception of Acapulco - due to spiralling violence across the state. And it says: ""There have been several instances of armed crime, including shootings and executions, both within and outside the tourist areas in Acapulco."" A series of recent horrors have thrown the spotlight back on the idyllic party town's descent into hell. Last weekend a well-known Mexican journalist was executed in his car outside a shop in broad daylight. Nelson Matus, the boss of local site Lo Real de Guerrero, had already survived a previous assassination attempt. Last week a cop was killed by a car bomb and 13 government officials were taken hostage by cartel members who staged a fake demo to block the main highway to Acapulco. Hundreds of locals were allegedly forced to pose as protesters demanding the release of jailed gangsters, closing the road for two days in a standoff with the police and army. In January, five dismembered bodies were found stuffed in plastic bags in a village just outside Acapulco. And in November, horrifying pictures showed three corpses washed up close to sunbathers at Condesa, Acapulco's most popular beach. The victims showed signs of torture and one had his hand and foot tied to a cement anchor, police said. Earlier images from 2018 show cars driving around bloody corpses on the street as shootings became commonplace. Bloody cartel violence has plagued Acapulco for the past 15 years. Since 2012 - when murders peaked at 100 a month - the city has had the unfortunate nickname “Guerrero's Iraq”. Locals are said to fear going outside at all, and many go armed for their own protection. Experts say the violence erupted after dominant drugs cartels fragmented into a number of rival gangs. Large parts of central and southwestern Mexico were once ruled by the Beltran Leyva Organisation (BLO), in partnership with El Chapo's Sinaloa cartel . But in the late 2000s they began fighting each other, and then the BLO splintered into a number of vicious offshoot mobs. More recently the remnants of the BLO reportedly teamed up with the Jalisco New Generation cartel - notorious as the most brutal and ruthless of all Mexico's gangs. It is a far cry from Acapulco's Hollywood heyday when it became a playground for the rich and famous. Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley had big hits singing about the resort - an international byword for relaxed glamour in the jet age. Its fame spread after the Duke of Windsor visited in 1920 - followed by hoteliers and foreign investors. By the 1940s it was the favoured resort of the biggest names of Hollywood's golden age. One photo shows screen siren Rita Hayworth's 28th birthday party on board Errol Flynn's yacht in 1946. Hayworth's husband Orson Welles - pictured beside her - filmed his movie The Lady From Shanghai in the resort. John F Kennedy and his bride Jackie - the closest the US had to royalty - honeymooned in Acapulco in 1953. And Elizabeth Taylor married her 3rd husband Mike Todd there in 1957, with Debbie Reynolds as matron of honour and Eddie Fisher as best man. More than 10,000 flowers were flown in for the opulent ceremony held at the villa of Mexico's former president. “The resort is becoming the new sun spa for the international big rich and their attendant swingers,” Time magazine reported in 1966. It added breathlessly: “Already, Baron and Baroness Guy de Rothschild have bought a house, the Loel Guinnesses have just built one, the Clint Murchisons are just finishing one, the Samuel Newhouses are renting one, and the Douglas Fairbankses Jr are looking for one. ""Mexican millionaire Melchior Perusquia Jr is spending $5,000,000 to build a private development for what he calls ‘the best people in the world’, including Walt Disney and Frank Sinatra, who last month bought another Acapulco house.” Sinatra once flew his pals in for a secret birthday party and went back to visit dozens of times. The tourist boom turned this sleepy town of 5,000 into a bustling city of two million in a few decades. It was even the subject of the Four Tops 1988 novelty hit Going Loco Down In Acapulco which sang about how ""the magic"" in the town was ""so strong"". Although the glamour faded, Acapulco continued to be one into the world's most famous holiday destinations, known for its beautiful people and party vibe late into the 20th century. Its decline began when package holidays took millions of tourists to the new boom resorts such as Cancun on the east coast. Now the ""magic"" has been replaced by hideous bloodshed, revenge and fear. Local businesses that rely on tourism have tried to rebuild its reputation for carefree fun. But they have been left in despair after spiralling crime forced foreign governments to issued stark warnings to visitors. Armed guards and soldiers are stationed outside the bigger hotels, but far from reassuring visitors it only reminds them of the danger, an ex-mayor said. There a few international visitors these days, with most tourists coming from elsewhere in Mexico. Last month, local media reports a sorry scene on the once-glam seafront. Newspapers lament the ""deplorable conditions"", with old and broken chairs and umbrellas available for sunbathers and access steps to beaches in a state of disrepair. The same problems have persisted for years but little effort is made to fix them because of the ""anarchy"", reports The Sun of Acapulco . And with the government's war on cartels struggling to make progress, locals fear it will be a long time before they see a return to the glory years.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sensitive-material-image-offend-disturb-775378212.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-southern-tourist-town-acapulco-832029560.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/portrait-elizabeth-taylor-husband-mike-385662674.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-rocky-coastline-illuminated-promenade-832949076.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-facebook-com-acapulcoeneltiempo-photos-832950128.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hayworth-actress-husband-orson-welles-832950130.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000832950131.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo-ivan-dmitri-michael-ochs-832937143.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/visual-coverage-scenes-injury-death-832946121.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sensitive-material-image-offend-disturb-775378755.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/af-muzz-burnt-2.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/erroneous-mention-s-appearing-metadata-832211177.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/graphic-content-man-woman-help-832977162.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-elsoldeacapulco-com-mx-local-832976099.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-elsoldeacapulco-com-mx-local-832976107.jpg",How Acapulco went from glam celeb haunt to cartel-ridden hell hole plagued with corpses on beaches & gangland shootings,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23115265/acapulco-glam-resort-cartel-hell-hole/
"GERMAN cops are still scouring a woodland area in Berlin as their search for the missing lioness enters its second day. Hundreds of officers joined ""Operation Lion Hunt"" in the capital's southern suburbs but no trace of the animal was found overnight. The Brandenburg police said early today there is still no sign of the missing big cat and today's search efforts will be focused in the Wannsee-Düppel dog park. A massive police operation resumed this morning with another 120 cops as professional hunters and vets armed with tranquilising guns joined the efforts to capture the animal safely. Terrified residents in the districts of Kleinmachnow, Teltow and Stahnsdorf have been warned to ""stay inside"" as it is feared the escaped lioness is hiding in the Nikolassee forest. Officers frantically looking for the lioness last night, had to investigate further after locals reported hearing ""roaring sounds""- but it turned out to be a sick hoax, Rbb reported. Berlin cops tweeted: ""Our colleagues investigated this together with a veterinarian and the city hunter. ""Even with the help of a drone, the clues could not be confirmed."" However two firefighters claimed they had spotted the lioness in the afternoon, police said. German newspaper Bild , using geo-software to pinpoint the location where the lioness was spotted, reported it was feet away from a property. Police spokesperson Daniel Keip said: ""In the summer, you often hear reports of crocodiles in swimming lakes and then it turns out all it was, was a big duck. In this case, it's obviously totally real. ""We're dealing with a lioness that's roaming freely through Teltow, Stahnsdorf and Kleinmachnow."" Michael Grubert, the mayor of Kleinmachnow, said the lioness is also said to have been sighted in his community. ""It can't go on like this for days,"" he told Bild while he noted the warning is still in place. But an animal expert warned the escaped lioness could have actually wandered to a different city. Markus Köchling explained: ""When the streets are less crowded, maybe she'll start walking. Lions usually sleep in captivity at night. ""In the case of the lioness, however, I assume that she tends to wander in the dark. ""Then it can happen that she covers 10 to 15 kilometers within a few hours and runs to another urban area."" Since local zoo , circus or wildlife sanctuary has reported a creature missing, the animal was presumably kept illegally as a pet. Markus does not think it will be able to return to its owner and added: ""Unlike a dog, which is regularly walked by its master, the lioness doesn't know Kleinmachnow. "" Five experienced hunters with tranquilliser guns were said to be combing the region alongside veterinarians, while police used thermal imagery to scour the area. A 15-ton special task force armoured vehicle known as ""Survivor"" also entered the hunt to assist the helicopters and drones. More than 100 police officers had stepped up on duty and a police spokesman said multiple groups were out last night. ""We're following up on every tip,"" they said. Horrified residents have been warned to stay indoors and continue avoiding the southern forest areas of Berlin beyond the city limits. German authorities have been baffled by the sightings as no local zoo , circus or wildlife sanctuary has reported a creature missing. ""We don't know where it came from,"" he said. Meanwhile, Tiger King star Carole Baskin has issued an urgent warning about what to do if you come face-to-face with a hungry lion. Carole told The Sun that the ""alarming"" reports raise ""serious concerns"" about where the beast came from and how it was contained. The Netflix star advised: ""My guidance to anyone who encounters her is to keep their distance and contact authorities immediately. ""Do not approach or interact with her, as she may interpret it as aggression. ""If raised by humans she will be more inclined to fight than flee. ""Her powerful natural weapons mean any direct contact risks severe injury."" She also advised if the animal is pumped up with adrenaline, a tranquilliser dart may not have been effective so remain cautious. The search for the animal was launched yesterday morning as police arrived with hunters, helicopters, armoured cars, drones and tranquilliser guns. A police spokesperson yesterday said: ""We have deployed massive forces at the site to protect the population."" ""We are currently working on the assumption that the animal is a lioness,"" a spokesperson later added. The suspected lioness was first sighted by locals who reported seeing a big cat running after a wild boar. ""Around midnight, witnesses saw a predator tearing down a wild boar,"" police spokesman Daniel Kiep told Bild , adding that wild boars are common in the area. ""We also got video material about it. It is therefore a lioness. There is currently no reason for us to doubt its authenticity."" The search area was then extended further into southern Berlin as the animal remained free. Vet Dr. Fred Willizkat told Bild that lions on the loose are not necessarily hungry but they're unpredictable. ""That's what makes it dangerous,"" he said. ""A lion can attack anything that he doesn't know and that scares him."" A local resident, Mariam B said: ""The lioness must have been right on our doorstep because the police searched there very intensively!"" “Dogs were barking all over the neighbourhood. We were told over the loudspeaker that we were not allowed to leave the house"" she told Bild . ""Now we were finally allowed to take our children to the day care centre.” Another local mother, Beate Geeske, said: ""I think it's good that the children aren't allowed out. ""But I didn't worry too much on the way here. I walked where there are still people on the street.” A Kleinmachnow spokesperson said children at kindergartens are not allowed to enter the gardens, while sellers at local markets were advised not to set up stalls yet. She added: ""There are hardly any people there. This sort of thing doesn't happen every day."" Should anyone run into the wild animal, the main thing is not to panic, said Florian Eiserlo of the Four Paws animal welfare organisation. ""Stand still, stay calm, try to head to a safe area such as a car or a building,"" Eiserlo told the Rheinische Post. Once the animal is found, it will likely be sedated with a tranquilliser and taken to an animal shelter, said police spokesperson Kiep.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/woman-carries-tranquilizer-gun-members-833018414.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c55b083f-6b26-4228-b23a-2b72a019e073.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-authorities-warned-people-832908111.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vermummte-elite-polizisten-mit-maschinengewehr-832974117.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TM-Graphic-Lion-Hunt.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-officers-hunter-start-search-833182086.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-authorities-warned-people-833167580.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mrs-taenzer-72-astrid-viti-833156469.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-bild-de-regional-berlin-832921741.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vermummte-elite-polizisten-mit-maschinengewehr-832973583.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-police-searching-helicopters-833021297.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/police-helicopter-takes-part-search-832951112.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/suche-nach-entlaufenem-raubtier-auch-832977344.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-authorities-warned-people-832906814.jpg",Cops hunting ‘Beast of Berlin lion’ swoop in on dog park after ‘roaring sounds heard overnight’ probed,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23118878/cops-operation-lion-hunt-snipers-armoured-vehicles-lioness-berlin/
"A REALITY TV star has been slammed by disgusted fans after he shared a twisted Snapchat video of himself running over a deer. Farmer Matt Trewin, 28, who appeared in Australia 's Farmer Wants a Wife series, faced backlash after posting the clip on Snapchat . The sickening footage shows the former reality contestant running over and killing a deer while hunting. The video was then shared by one of his followers who wrote in the caption: ""Matt Trewin thought it would be funny to put up a Snapchat story of him literally running over a sambar deer."" In the video Matt is seen swerving across the road trying to hit the animal, So Dramatic! reported. While deer hunting in Victoria is legal, there are certain rules in place such as specific locations and times of the year hunting is allowed while hunters must hold a license. Matt was seen chasing the deer around 9.30pm. According to Australia 's laws, hunters must only use appropriate and approved firearms. Under the Wildlife Game Regulations Act and the Wildlife Act, terrorising animals with a car is not considered a legal hunting method. The code details that ""the improper and illegal use of vehicles is considered to be highly unethical"". It adds that hunters ""must avoid mechanised pursuit in any form"" as ""a true hunter makes every effort to ensure the contest is as fair as possible"". The laws do state, however, that if deer are “causing damage”, they can be “controlled using methods that aren’t permitted for recreational hunting, under strict controls”. “But they cannot be destroyed without authorisation.” When contacted by the outlet regarding the video, Matt responded that he ""can’t help if [the deer are] on the road"". He said: ""I have a game hunting licence and I also have permits to remove them from private property."" The Sun Online has contacted Matt for a comment.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/farmer-wants-wife-australia-star-832952312.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/farmer-wants-wife-australia-star-832951746.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/farmer-wants-wife-australia-star-832952369.jpg",Reality TV star leaves fans disgusted after sharing sick Snapchat video running over deer,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23116990/reality-tv-star-fans-disgusted-sick-snapchat-video/
"A MAN embroiled in an explosive three-year feud with his neighbour has told how their tit-for-tat war has escalated to the extreme. Aymen and his elderly mother say they have simply ""had enough"" of the woman living next door making their lives a misery. He explained the row has even forced him to heighten the fence that divides the properties in New South Wales, Australia , to keep her prying eyes out. The Canley Heights resident said he was baffled that his neighbours alleged campaign of abuse has persisted for so long. The pair had originally got along well when he first moved in - until they clashed over where Ayman's mum had parked her car. He told A Current Affair: ""My mum parked in front of her house on the road and she didn't like that. ""So she came at her and started shouting at her. She's not a reasonable person. She will just swear at you."" The bust-up marked the start of his continually deteriorating relationship with the woman, which has now reached drastic new lows. Aymen shared surveillance footage showing him rowing with the fiery resident over their shared fence on the quiet street. He claims his neighbour from hell has forced him to repeatedly raise the height of the barrier in an attempt to stop her expletive-ridden rants on a daily basis. But Ayman joked he ""still wished it was higher"", as he says it has done little to deter her from shouting and swearing at him. He has even fortified it with a line of sandbags to help strengthen his makeshift blockade. Other residents on the street have been blaring music through speakers to try and drown out the noise of the repeated disputes. Ayman claims the woman even propped up a sign at the front of her home with the words ""paedophile alert"" alongside a doodle of a devil. The fed-up son continued: ""I was in shock, because that's not what I am. I called the cops and they made her take it down. ""It's a nightmare. I think my neighbour is a vile, disgusting, rude creature."" He now hopes the Department of Communities and Justice, which handle housing Down Under, will step in to finally bring his three years of hell to an end. Aymen added: ""I'm hoping she either gets evicted or they give my mum a transfer. ""We've put up with her stuff for so long and we've just had enough of it."" The neighbour was heard telling a reporter she had ""no peace in her"" when she was asked about resolving the feud. She refused to discuss the situation on camera and instead claimed they had ""got the wrong house."" The Department of Communities and Justice said in a statement: ""The DCJ has a robust policy framework in place to address illegal and antisocial behaviour issues in NSW Government social housing properties. ""The DCJ does not tolerate illegal activity and antisocial behaviour and takes complaints seriously and have spoken to NSW Police in relation to the reported concerns. ""We have evicted social housing tenants for antisocial behaviour and will continue to seek the eviction of tenants who engage in illegal and antisocial behaviour. ""We will continue to work with the tenants involved to address their concerns."" We previously told how a doctor who ripped down a fence in a neighbour row over a 20ft strip between homes was hit with a £200,000 bill .

"A CHAMPION freediver clambers on board a boat with blood pouring from his leg after being savaged by a shark. Dramatic video footage shows Cristian Castaño being helped by friends after he was ambushed on a training dive in the Caribbean. Cristian, 38, and his fellow athletes were practising diving without oxygen ahead of the world championships later this month. Suddenly an oceanic whitetip shark attacked him and bit his right leg and both hands near Colombia 's San Andrés islands on Tuesday. Rangers from Coralina, the environmental agency in the marine park, were close by and raced to help in their boat. The video shows Cristian nursing his wounded leg after he hauled himself out of the water. Blood can be seen smeared over the side of the vessel before he was taken to shore and then to hospital. The video also shows the large grey shark swimming close by following the attack. Later Cristian posted a photo from his hospital bed on Instagram, showing his leg and hands in bandages. He joked: ""You should see how the shark turned out."" He suffered a number of bites, but was released later after the wounds were stitched. Cristian is a freediving teacher and a member of Colombia's national team preparing for the world championships in Honduras. The Coralina agency said the group had been ""surprised by several oceanic whitetip sharks that frequent deep areas"". It added: ""One of the sharks bit (out of curiosity) a freediver... a situation that did not become serious thanks to the quick reaction of Coralina's personnel who were in the area and managed to help the divers."" The the diver was able to lift himself onto the boat during his rescue and remained conscious the whole time, it said. The agency said it will be on the lookout for sharks in to make sure there are no further attacks. But it added: “It is important to remind the community that sharks are in their natural habitat and it is humans who enter their domain. “Therefore, we must have greater respect for nature and take precautions for this type of encounter.” Last year an Italian tourist died after a shark attack in the San Andrés islands. Antonio Straccialini, 56, was mauled by an 8ft tiger shark which tore a chunk from his leg as he swum near a cliff. In April this year, Coralina issued a warning against tour operators dumping pig carcasses into the sea to attract sharks and offer sightings near the islands.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/c5476c06-f4a3-4649-a194-59677dcb6c74.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/041136e7-9122-4fb5-bddc-305b263a50ce.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9eb3439c-0113-4b61-be17-da3bef6fdba5.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6c54bdec-a9fa-41cb-97f2-9c122cceb01a.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/de497194-14f7-41e6-aca9-60e334a1d97b.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/curiosity-one-athletes-identified-cristian-832986093.jpg",Horror moment diver mauled by shark clambers back into boat with blood pouring from his leg after savage attack,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23119372/diver-mauled-shark-blood-video-colombia/
"THE mercury is set to hit 39C on the Magaluf strip as much of Europe continues to be scorched by boiling weather. Brits are continuing to jet off to Majorca to enjoy the sun, as a yellow weather warning has been issued across much of southern Spain . The hot weather will persist through the weekend, and could hit 39C in Vega del Segura tomorrow. Marbella will see temperatures of more than 40C, with some parts of the interior of the region seeing 42C. The heat is so intense that even palm trees are wilting, with one filmed snapping in half. Local media said that between July 17 and 18, nearly a dozen palm trees in Alicante province met the same fate. Elche, Benidorm, and Torrevieja are among the places where palms have come crashing down amid the scorching heat. In recent days, Benidorm Brits have continued to hit the booze as they defy heat storm Charon. But in true ""keep calm and carry on"" style, nothing was going to ruin these Brits' getaways as they smiled through the heat in the Spanish party town. The Foreign Office has also warned Brits heading to Europe to take care due to the possible health risks associated with ""extreme"" heat, particularly in Spain and Greece . Holidaymakers are being advised to avoid drinking alcohol and caffeine as the mercury rises in countries across the Mediterranean. Forecasters from the United Nations ' weather agency the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) have warned that the hot weather is expected to persist into the start of August. The UN agency said the weather - which is refusing to relent even overnight - brings an increased risk of heart attacks and deaths. Weather experts have declared 2023 an El Niño year - a natural phenomenon that occurs cyclically and causes fluctuations in the global climate.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/british-holidaymakers-seen-back-force-832988558.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tourists-locals-returned-bars-terraces-582341633.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spain-weather-warning-temperatures-set-833010049.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epa10755500-man-rests-shade-thermometer-832756215.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/unusually-empty-street-midday-magaluf-832756618.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/people-sunbathe-burriana-beach-nerja-365371846.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/passengers-queue-check-in-desks-738037849.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/unusually-empty-street-midday-magaluf-832753310.jpg",Spain weather warning with temperatures set to hit 39C as Brits jet off for the school holidays & hit the Magaluf strip,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23121850/spain-weather-warning-heat-magaluf-brits-abroad/
"NORTH Korea threatened to use nukes today as it warned the prospect of war with the South was now a ""dangerous reality"". Kim Jong-un's regime raised the stakes amid heightened tensions after a US Trident missile submarine docked in South Korea. The allies are holding talks over how to contain the threat of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Kim test fired his most powerful ballistic missile yet last week. And he fired two more yesterday in a show of force after the USS Kentucky sailed to his doorstep. It was the first time the US has sent a nuclear-armed submarine to South Korea since 1981. Today the North's defence minister Kang Sun-nam issued a chilling warning that the deployment itself could justify nuclear force. The presence of US aircraft carriers and bombers could also trigger North Korea 's nuclear protocol, he warned. The minister said: ""The ever-increasing visibility of the deployment of the strategic nuclear submarine and other strategic assets may fall under the conditions of the use of nuclear weapons specified in the DPRK law."" He accused the US of escalating tensions and added: ""The phase of a military clash on the Korean peninsula has surfaced as a dangerous reality."" Last year, the reclusive state codified an expansive law declaring its status as a nuclear-armed state ""irreversible"". Dictator Kim Jong-un said at the time: ""The utmost significance of legislating nuclear weapons policy is to draw an irretrievable line so that there can be no bargaining over our nuclear weapons."" The West is growing increasingly concerned over Kim's missile program, which has accelerated in the past 18 months. There have been dozens of test launches including bigger rockets that could theoretically reach US territory in the Pacific. Kim's scientists are also feared to have made nuclear bombs small enough to be carried on a missile , a UN report said. This week the US and South Korea held their first meeting of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) in Seoul - aimed at ""bolstering nuclear deterrence against North Korea"". The allies are also staging joint war drills with advanced stealth jets and other US strategic assets as tensions mount in the region. On Tuesday the 18,750ton USS Kentucky entered a key naval base in Busan, 200 miles southeast of Seoul. It is one of the largest nuke-capable subs in the world - and can carry more than 20 Trident-II ballistic missiles. The South's defence Minister Lee Jong-sup said the deployment demonstrates a united force against Kim Jong-un. He said: ""To North Korea, it shows the overwhelming capabilities and posture of the alliance, while it demonstrates the solid combined defence posture of South Korea and the United States to our people and the international community."" Meanwhile diplomats were trying to establish details on a US soldier who is claimed to have defected to the North earlier this week. Travis King, 23, reportedly shouted ""Ha ha ha!"" as he sprinted across the border during a tourist trip to the DMZ. The private second class had been stationed in South Korea and was due to be sent home after being convicted of assault and damaging a police car. Today the White House said the US government has reached out to the North Korean military through ""multiple channels"" trying to learn more on King's whereabouts and welfare.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pen-news-claim-ownership-including-832116855.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hwasong-18-undisclosed-location-north-831360910-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-north-korea-fired-two-832723391.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/u-s-army-soldier-travis-832813111-1.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-long-photo-taken-travis-832840870-1.jpg",North Korea warns war now ‘dangerous reality’ & threatens to use nukes after US submarine arrives for war games,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23121691/north-korea-nuclear-war-dangerous-reality-submarine/
"THE self-proclaimed world's hottest truck driver has revealed how she makes £60,000 working just six months a year. Ashlea, from Perth, Australia , took to TikTok to explain her unusual career that sees her take on early starts and gruelling 12-hour shifts. Working as a fly-in fly-out (FIFO) driver at the Pilbara Mines in remote Western Australia, her shift pattern is an intensive 14 days on followed by 14 days off. When she's on the clock, she wakes up at 4am to spend most of her day transporting rubble and heavy goods, but during her two-week breaks she loves to travel and treat herself. And she certainly can with her salary of AUS$120,000, which is around £60,000. Despite her job, Ashlea doesn't fit the often unfair stereotype of truck drivers, with her social media revealing her glam style and passion for fitness . In a TikTok clip she said: ""I have an awesome life. ""I do a two-and-two roster, so every month I have two weeks off, so that gives me plenty of time to do some really awesome things. ""I make it a priority in my life to do super cool s***. ""I’m always going to events, I’m always partying, I’m always travelling, I’m always eating out , I’m just doing everything that I love to do."" She added that the fact that she has no children and is "" single by choice"" help her in being able to live life on her own terms. However, she didn't always have such a sweet deal. When she started out as a ""greenie"" (or trainee driver) she made around £18 an hour, but that has now increased to £29. She also has all her flights , accommodation and meals paid for while on the job and receives bonuses each year. Commenters were left astonished by her unique lifestyle . One wrote: ""Wow I'm a midwife and we get nowhere near that - I might change."" Another said: ""You seriously inspire me. ""I've wanted to work in mining since I was little but didn't because I thought it was only for men.""

"L'AQUATIC Paradis water park near Barcelona opened in the early 1990s - and never caused a splash. The spooky Spanish theme park has sat abandoned for almost 30 years - rotting, decaying and terrifying the locals due to the grim urban legend behind its closure. After only two seasons of being opened, L'Aqautic Paradis closed its doors, and ever since has been plagued with disturbing rumours over the death of an infant. Local legend states that the child was killed after being sucked into the engine of a wave machine, which forced the closure of the already unpopular park. The 13-acre site quickly fell into disrepair and has remained untouched ever since - haunting the landscape and those that live nearby. Covered in graffiti and rubbish, the site has been used by squatters, skaters and illegal party-goers for years. Disturbing footage shows acres of land covered in broken water slides, slimy green pools, collapsed pavilions and roofless buildings. L'Aqautic Paradis was built near the seaside resort town of Sitges after the area was riding an investment high following the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona . However, the water park seemed largely out of place in the "" Saint Tropez of Spain"" and received very few visitors. It didn't help that just down the coast in Salou, Spain's biggest theme park PortAventura opened in 1995. It became the must-stop destination for families in Catalonia and pulled even more visitors away from L'Aquatic Paradis. The theme park suffered from the competition and a lack of sponsorship and the owners alleged made serious cuts. Safety was reportedly an issue, and rumours began to swirl of the child fatality. After the park racked up big debts and bad press - it shut its doors for good after two years. But the frightening story behind its closures has lived on. It comes as another Spanish theme park has been left frozen in time with no guests , but the staff still turn up. Tivoli World was once considered one of the best theme parks to visit along the Costa Del Sol , but it closed in 2020 due to the pandemic. The park, which opened in 1976, was boarded up after more than 45 years - but thanks to a bizarre contractual loophole, all its staff remain employed. Elsewhere, a deserted amusement park - that once boasted a crocodile pit, fake volcano and Indonesia's biggest swimming pool - is now considered the most haunted place in Bali. Taman Festival was built at a cost of £70million, but it was mysteriously abandoned in 2000 before ever truly opening.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014493.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014514.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014515.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014496.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014517.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014512.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014495.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014519.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000833014492.jpg",Inside ‘world’s creepiest’ abandoned water park in Spain – and the haunting reason it was shut down for good,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23121387/inside-worlds-creepiest-abandoned-water-park-spain-mystery/
"TIGER King star Carole Baskin has issued an urgent warning over what to do if you come face-to-face with a hungry lion. The advice comes as a big cat, believed to be a lioness , is reportedly on the loose in Berlin, Germany . Carole told The Sun that the ""alarming"" reports raise ""serious concerns"" about where the beast came from and how it was contained. German authorities have been baffled by the sightings as no local zoo , circus or wildlife sanctuary has reported a creature missing. The Netflix star advised: ""My guidance to anyone who encounters her is to keep their distance and contact authorities immediately. ""Do not approach or interact with her, as she may interpret it as aggression. ""If raised by humans she will be more inclined to fight than flee. ""Her powerful natural weapons mean any direct contact risks severe injury."" Carole also warned search teams that tranquillizer darts may not be effective if the animal is ""amped up on adrenaline"" and urged them to be cautious. She speculated that the cat may be an unregistered exotic pet that has escaped from a personal collection. Cops in Berlin are currently trying to track the beast down after it was spotted in the southern area of the city chasing a wild boar. A 15-ton special task force armoured vehicle known as ""Survivor"" also entered the hunt today. A police spokesperson this morning said: ""We have deployed massive forces at the site to protect the population."" ""We are currently working on the assumption that the animal is a lioness."" Carole, meanwhile, added that she hoped for a ""swift and peaceful"" solution to the hunt, with no harm coming to the animal or any of those searching for it.","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000610910815.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7eaa8618-1478-48a1-8ee1-1f2cb9117f9c.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/p7p4ek-angry-roaring-lion-kruger-495974280.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-authorities-warned-people-832956790.jpg,https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-german-authorities-warned-people-832956894-1.jpg","Do NOT approach a hungry lion, says Tiger King star Carole Baskin in urgent warning as beast roams the streets of Berlin",https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23123932/hungry-lion-tiger-king-carole-baskin-berlin/
